Introduction
Efficient power production has always been one of the challenges for the
exploration of space and the solar system. The challenge is even greater at increasing
distance from the Sun or beneath planetary surfaces, where solar light intensity levels
and extreme temperatures could preclude the use of solar power and chemical power
generation systems. Figure 1.1 illustrates solar intensity as a function of orbital radius
from the sun. When in orbit around Mars, a spacecraft is illuminated by 60 % less
sunlight than when in an Earth orbit. The same spacecraft would receive only 5 % of
the sunlight it receives at Earth at an orbit of equal radius to Jupiter. High efficiency
photovoltaic (PV) cells are reported up to 40% efficiency [1] but for flagship class
missions where electrical power budgets are typically several hundred to kilowatts [2],
PV arrays become large for orbits beyond Jupiter. The presence of a large PV array on a
deep space craft is likely to introduce rotational torques that must be constantly
countered, and flight through regions of elevated debris content such as in the Kuiper
belt presents an elevated probability of mechanical damage to the cells. Damage to
solar cells by natural background radiation such as protons and electrons with energies
of the order of keV to GeV [3, 4] is significantly limiting on the lifetime of a solar
array, especially in orbits around planets such as Jupiter which posses magnetic fields
that typically trap charged particles similar to the Earth’s Van Allen belts [5].
Additional power burdens on the budgets available for certain missions may be
imposed by systems that have specific operating temperatures and temperature control
requirements.2

Radioisotope power systems have been used to provide energy for thermal
management and up to hundreds of Watts of electrical power over long lifetime
missions in regions where solar illumination is greatly reduced or where background
radiation is elevated [6]. Most recently, the NASA New Horizons mission to Pluto,
launched in 2006, is powered by a single Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator
(RTG) [7]. Reducing the mass, maximising the efficiency, and improving the physical
safety and security of radioisotope power sources will have a positive impact on the
overall mass budgets of science payloads and the range of mission scenarios for a
specific project.3
Nuclear fission reactors have also been developed that are capable of delivering
kilowatts of electrical power for power intensive applications. To date, spaceflight
heritage of reactor systems has been confined to missions in Earth orbit such as under
the U.S. SNAPSHOT [6] and Russian Cosmos missions [8]. Adaptation of nuclear
fission technologies have been applied to the field of spacecraft propulsion, leading to
the development and ground testing of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) systems.
The limitation and restriction of the use of nuclear power and NTP up to the present day
is significantly attributed to safety concerns amidst the challenge of nuclear fuel
encapsulation and its impact upon launch safety.
A historical overview of international nuclear power and propulsion systems
developed for space applications is presented in chapter 2 of this thesis. The power
conversion mechanisms that may be adopted by radioisotope and nuclear power
systems are evaluated and presented in Appendix A.
Isotope Selection is of great importance to the overall performance, specific
mass, radiation safety and lifetime of a radioisotope power system. The modes of
decay, half-lives and origin of radioisotopes are most significant to the isotope selection
process. 238Pu has been most widely adopted for radioisotope power systems. An
evaluation of the performance of alternative radioisotopes is presented in chapter 4 and
comparison is made to that of 238Pu. Specifically, Monte Carlo analysis was performed
for the substitution of 238Pu fuel within the U.S. General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS)
{Bennett, 2006 #14} architecture (see chapters 3 & 4) by 208Po, 210Po, 241Am and 90Sr
and the comparison of radiation dose rates delivered to the local environment is made.
As a consequence of this study, the use of 241Am is proposed. 241Am is attractive due to4
its abundance in the commercial nuclear power fuel cycle and commercial availability
in addition to its reduced impact upon the local radiation environment when combined
within an appropriate encapsulation scheme.
The extraction of radioisotopes from discharged commercial reactor fuels is also
evaluated in chapter 4 with particular attention given to the extraction of composite
blends of americium and curium isotopes. Such composite isotopic compounds may be
used to fuel RTG systems where the production of 238Pu is uneconomical while
delivering a similar specific thermal power (Wth/g).
For radioisotope power systems, the encapsulation mechanisms and
architectures adopted are essential for launch safety and handling of the systems during
assembly. Traditionally, such schemes must provide physical retention and isolation of
the hazardous materials while providing ventilation for radiogenic gases generated by
the radioactive decay of the encapsulated materials. Thermal protection must be
provided so as to ensure intact atmospheric re-entry of radioisotope heat sources while
providing efficient thermal conductivity to power conversion systems during normal
operation. The traditional encapsulation architectures discussed in chapter 3 require
concentric assembly of cladding and aeroshell structures, thus occupying volumes much
greater than that occupied by the isotopic materials. As an alternative to the traditional
encapsulation mechanisms adopted by radioisotope power systems, the encapsulation of
isotopic materials within a tungsten matrix is proposed (see chapter 5). Tungsten
matrices are proposed and evaluated for radiation shielding characteristics and
reduction in delivered dose to the localised environment throughout chapter 4. It is
anticipated that matrices based on tungsten and alloys of tungsten are capable of5
surviving the high temperatures, in excess of 2000 K [9], which are typically
experienced during atmospheric re-entry, such as in the event of launch related
accidents [10, 11]. Methods of tungsten encapsulate production are proposed and
demonstrated in chapter 5. Specifically, Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is proposed and
evaluated for its capability to process tungsten ceramic-metallic matrices (cermets) at
temperatures of around 40% of its melting temperature [10]. Such temperatures are
typically below those at which significant volatization of ceramic isotopic compounds
occurs [10].
An experimental demonstration of americium oxide encapsulation within a
tungsten cermet matrix was performed by the author and is discussed in chapter 6. Here
an 241AmO2 powdered feedstock was mixed with tungsten powder (3 - 6 µm) and
sintered via pressureless sintering in a differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) furnace.
In doing so, validation of reaction kinetics for the theoretical system was performed.
Estimation of the specific thermal power for the 241AmO2 feedstock was also made via
measurement of the bulk cermet temperature and DSC analysis. This was found to be
approximately 0.094 Wth/g.
Further development of SPS processing capabilities has led to the development
of tungsten cermet nuclear fuel elements with integrated coolant channels [12]. It is
anticipated that the adaptation of tungsten matrices for space power and NTP reactor
fuels may present a solution to the problems such as propellant compatibility that gave
rise to the physical failure of fuel elements during ground tests performed under the
U.S. Rover and NERVA NTP programs (see chapters 2 and 5). In addition, the high
melting temperatures of tungsten and tungsten alloys will allow for the operation of6
space reactors at temperatures up to 3000 °C and hence for an improvement in overall
system efficiency. Improvements in the physical safety and security through the use of
tungsten based reactor cores is also presented in chapters 2 and 5.
Clearly, the adaptation of nuclear technologies allows for the advancement of
mission capabilities. As such, these technologies may provide key enabling strategies
and systems for missions that would be excessively mass intensive, uneconomical or
too complex through the use of conventional power production and propulsion. Three
examples of missions that may be enabled by radioisotope and nuclear technologies are
proposed and discussed in Chapter 7.
The findings of this research and proposed future work are summarised in the
final chapter of this thesis.

An overview of radioisotope and nuclear technologies for space
Radioisotope Heating Units (RHUs) and Radioisotope Power Sources (RPSs)
are devices that are capable of producing thermal energy for thermal control purposes,
or electrical energy respectively by harnessing the energy released by the radioactive
decay of radioisotope materials. These technologies have been successfully employed
on a number of space missions and used extensively in terrestrial applications. Russian
built ‘Beta-M’ Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) fuelled with Strontium-
90 were deployed in unmanned lighthouses, coastal beacons and remote weather and
environment monitoring stations and had a typical power output of around 230 Watts
electrical (We) [1]. The original network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) built
by the United States in Antarctica was powered by RTGs; however, by the early 1990s
safety concerns led to the removal of these power sources [2]. Today, RTG devices
have become safer in design due to advances in material fabrication techniques.

Finnmark Region Government.9
To date, 238Pu has been the most commonly used radioisotope fuel for RTGs
and RHUs for space applications, although other isotopes have had some laboratory and
flight history. The main rationale for the use of the plutonium isotope was primarily
economic due to the existence in the U.S. of the large infrastructure that was established
after the Manhattan project to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The use of these
existing facilities allowed for the production of 238Pu with very minor alterations to
production and extraction lines. 238Pu decays primarily by alpha emission, where the
kinetic energy of the alpha particle is approximately 5 MeV. 238Pu can also decay by
spontaneous fission with a very low probability [3]. The absorption of the alpha
particles (and any fission products) by the source material matrix will result in the
conversion of kinetic energy into heat that can be exploited to generate electricity by
means of a power conversion system, in the form of thermoelectric junctions or other
power conversion mechanisms.
The power budgets for modern flagship missions often call for the use of a
significant number of radioisotope power systems that in some cases imposes limitation
on system availability for subsequent missions (see section 2.5 below). The use of
nuclear fission power sources in space is highly desirable given the availability of
nuclear fuels. Through consideration for specific power density, fission power sources
can be scaled between hundreds of watts to megawatts of electrical power generation.
Through careful design and selection of power conversion mechanisms, a system of
high reliability, safety and long operational lifetime can be conceived. The
controllability of fission power reactors allows for a system to be started, shutdown and
regulated at any given moment during a mission and unlike radioisotope power
systems, are not driven by the decay rate and radiological inventory at production.10

NASA/JPL.
In modern mission concept design, the use of fission reactors in space is often
coupled to the provision of electrical power for both instrumentation and propulsion via
plasma or ion engines. Early reactor systems were often based on fuel forms that could
not achieve high temperatures. As such, Nuclear Electric Propelled (NEP) spacecraft
designs such as the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) required large radiators for heat
rejection from the power conversion mechanism. See Figure 2.2. By driving reactor
systems to higher operational temperatures, the surface area of a radiator can be
reduced. Such operation will require the use of advanced high temperature reactor fuels
and the careful selection of materials and processing of the fuel forms. Advances in
such techniques are proposed and discussed by the author (see chapter 5) in the context
of high temperature reactors for nuclear thermal rocket propulsion.11
2.1 Power conversion
The overall efficiency of any given radioisotope or nuclear power system is
limited most fundamentally by the efficiency of the power conversion mechanism or
series of mechanisms employed. Commonly, the production of electrical power is
achieved most efficiently through the conversion of heat via a mechanical intermediate
stage. For space applications requiring nuclear or radioisotopic power generation, the
added complexity and mass of mechanical power conversion systems was historically
unacceptable given the already significant probability of mission failure due to
propulsion and guidance systems alone. Instead, solid state and direct energy
conversion mechanisms were developed so as to minimise space mission failure
probabilities attributed to spacecraft power supply. Significant development of
thermoelectric conversion was made for lower temperature applications (primarily
radioisotopic power) while thermionic power conversion was developed for space
fission reactor systems.
The optimistic pro-nuclear future outlook of the 1950s and 1960s in which an
abundant supply of radioisotopic materials would be produced allowed for the historical
adoption of the somewhat inefficient power conversion technologies for use within
radioisotope power systems in order to maximise reliability and lifetime. At the time of
writing, space agencies are faced with the converse global situation in which economic
and political restrictions have led to a shortfall in supply of radioisotopic materials
while the number of civilian missions alone demand more material than can currently
be produced. For this reason alternative power conversion mechanisms to
thermoelectric generation should be, and are under consideration.12
Many contributing parameters must be considered when selecting a given power
conversion mechanism for a specific application. Consideration of the operational
lifetime, local environmental influences and complexity of a power conversion
mechanism are vital in mission specific selection. It is apparent that although several
conversion mechanisms exist that are suitable for nuclear power systems, all must be
considered on merit for each target application. Clearly, no single general-purpose
mechanism can be applied to all conceivable applications. The power conversion
methods and mechanisms that have been considered and developed for space
applications include:
• Thermoelectric conversion
• Thermionic conversion
• Direct energy conversion
• Thermoacoustic conversion
• Stirling cycle
• Brayton cycle
• Rankine cycle
A detailed discussion of the above power conversion mechanisms is presented
in Appendix A of this thesis.13
Figure 2.3: Comparison of dynamic power conversion cycle typical efficiencies verses the temperature
ratio between the cold and hot sides of the cycle [4].
Examination of dynamic power conversion cycles (see Figure 2.3) indicates that
for small and low power applications where the temperature ratios between the cold and
hot sides of the cycle are particularly large, the Rankine cycle is highly suitable. Under
the same conditions of large Tc/Th ratios, the Stirling cycle is favoured over the Brayton
cycle. Below a Tc/Th ratio of the order of 0.23, the Brayton and Stirling cycles are
equally favoured in efficiency over the Rankine cycle. The very nature of dynamic
power conversion technologies require moving components. It is essential therefore that
space system design is a highly motivational factor in converter design such that
vibrations and rotational torques be minimised.
Engineering challenges that must be addressed during the qualification of any
dynamic power converter are creep and structural fatigue effects and in the case of
rotating or sliding components, the replacement of mechanical bearings with contactless
gas bearings is critical.14
Similarly, thermionic power conversion has substantial spaceflight heritage but
the high temperatures required for efficient operation place the requirement on suitable
materials selection. Thermionic converters are typically sensitive to large temperature
transients due to CTE mismatches between differing electrode materials. Behaviour of
this nature may be intolerable by certain missions where variations in the temperature
and control of heat rejection surface may be lost or difficult such as missions that use an
inner solar orbit for a series of gravity assists prior to departure to colder outer and
extra-solar orbits.
Although thermoelectric power conversion efficiency is significantly lower than
dynamic power conversion cycles, its simplicity and predictable characteristics are well
suited to applications where no maintenance and longevity of the operational life of a
system is crucial. In addition, some instances of low power system design ( ~ 1 We)
may present significant challenge for the engineer when manufacturing an equivalent
dynamic converter, In such cases, the density of the overall thermoelectric system is
likely to be lower than that of dynamic systems.
Thus, the selection of power converter technologies must be facilitated by
definition of the operating parameters of the hot and cold sides of the nuclear system
including throughput power, heat rejection capacity and energy availability from the
nuclear heat source. Also of extreme significance for space nuclear power systems is
the specific power density of a conversion system and the system as a whole,
determined by the temperature regime and associated compatible materials, modern
engineering and manufacturing capabilities and the heat rejection technologies used.15
2.2 The U.S. SNAP and early space nuclear systems programs
Under the Systems Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) program, a range of RTGs
and small reactors were developed in the United States for space and military use. The
RTGs developed were successfully flown on several satellite and space exploration
missions [5]. The efficiencies of some of the early devices were between 4% and 5%
[6]. This was due to limitations in the power conversion process and losses within the
system. Later devices such as the Multi Hundred Watt (MHW) power sources flown on
the Voyager missions and the General Purpose Heat Source RTGs (GPHS-RTG) as
flown on board Galileo & Cassini missions have efficiencies of the order of 6.6% [6].
Figure 2.4: Presentation and demonstration of the 210Po fuelled SNAP 3 RTG to U.S. President
Eisenhower on the 16th of January 1959. Image courtesy of the United States Department of Energy.
Early iterations of the SNAP-19A design examined the use of 238Pu, 90Sr and
210Po but were never fuelled. SNAP-19B devices fuelled by 238Pu were successfully
used on the Nimbus B1 and Nimbus III meteorological satellites. A later derivation of
the device named SNAP-19 was used onboard the Pioneer 10 and 11 [5] and were also
included in the Viking 1 and 2 mars lander missions (two 35We units per lander) [7].16
The SNAP-19 devices were loaded with 238PuO2-Mo fuel cermets with a total activity
ranging from 34.4 kCi to 80 kCi [6] depending on the mission and application. The
casing for the SNAP-19 design was fabricated from Magnesium metal so as to provide
a secure but lightweight structure suitable for integration with mass constrained
missions such as the Viking landings on Mars.
Figure 2.5: The SNAP-19 RTG design Image courtesy of NASA.
The SNAP-27 devices that were landed on the moon during the Apollo 12, 14,
15, 16 and 17 missions were designed to provided a beginning of life (BOL) output
power of 63.5We (Electrical Power in Watts) and a specific power density of 3.2 We /kg
[6]. The SNAP-27 devices were used under these missions as power sources for lunar
surface science experiments with life spans ranging from 4 to 8 years. The total activity
of the SNAP-27 fuel source was 44.5 kCi and consisted of microspheres of 238PuO2
ceramic [6]. These devices had a power conversion system with a 5% efficiency based17
on PbSnTe junctions. The output voltages of the SNAP-27 devices were between 14 V
and 16 V D.C.
Figure 2.6: SNAP-27 RTG deployed on the lunar surface during the Apollo 16 mission [7].
Prior to the SNAP-19 design, the radioisotope heat sources for RTG systems
were designed to completely burn up and disperse over a large trajectory in the event of
launch or orbit failure of host spacecraft. After concerns about the safety of the
dispersal mechanism in relation to exposure of the biosphere to plutonium or other
radioisotope materials from what were becoming increasingly larger heat sources, it
was decided that all heat sources should be encased within a heat shield and impact
shell so as to minimise the risks of radiological exposure during accident scenarios by
ensuring that fuel containment is completely maintained upon re-entry into the Earth’s
atmosphere and impact at the Earth’s surface. Today, all designs for radioisotope power
sources for space applications must comply with resolution 47/68 of the United Nations
General Assembly regarding the use of nuclear power sources in space. This resolution
was passed on the 14th of December 1992 and states that RTGs and RHUs can be used18
in space provided that the physical form of the radioactive materials used and a system
of protective shells are employed so as to guarantee non-dispersal of radioactive matter
into the Earth’s environment during nominal use and conditions attributed to all
possible accident situations.
The failure of the Apollo 13 mission inadvertently enabled the testing of the
integrity of the SNAP-27 design during the re-entry of its lunar module into the Earth’s
atmosphere. The lunar module splashed down in the Tonga Trench in the Pacific
Ocean. No contamination has been detected to date and it is assumed that the SNAP-27
fuel capsule is intact at a depth of 6.5 km below the surface of the ocean. Even though
the integrity of the SNAP design during re-entry is not in question, the additional mass
of the separate aeroshell and cask used by this system reduced the overall system power
density which could be improved today by the adoption of alternative encapsulation
techniques.

model.
Following the SNAP programmes, the U.S. developed the Multi-hundred Watt
(MHW) RTG systems to provide power to the Lincoln Experimental Satellites LES 8
and 9 and Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft. These devices were fuelled by 24 pressed
spheres of 238PuO2, each with an activity of 3.2 kCi. Each sphere was encapsulated
within a cladding of iridium alloy and housed individually within a filament wound
carbon-carbon impact shell. All 24 assembled spheres were housed within a cylindrical
POCO graphite aeroshell for re-entry protection [6]. The thermoelectric conversion was
performed using SiGe junctions [8] with an efficiency of 6.7% [6]. The MHW RTGs
had a beginning of mission power level of 2.4 kWth [8] or 160.8 We. The overall
beginning of mission system power density was 4.2 W/kg [8].
Despite extensive ground based research into space reactor systems under the
SNAP program, only one reactor, SNAP-10A, was flown by the United States aboard
the SNAPSHOT spacecraft. SNAPSHOT was launched on the 3rd of April 1965 and
operated successfully for 43 days until a fault occurred within a voltage regulator
causing the premature shutdown of the SNAP-10A reactor. At the end of the mission,
the reactor was placed into an orbital altitude of 1300 km at which it is expected to20
reside for approximately 4000 years. Unlike the BES-5 reactor designs from the Soviet
Union (see below), the SNAP-10A reactor operated with a thermal neutron spectrum.
This was facilitated by the use of a uranium-zirconium hydride fuel form. The thermal
power output of the SNAP-10A was 42 kW, and through transfer of thermal energy to
PbTe thermoelectric converters via a sodium potassium (NaK) coolant loop, the
electrical power output of the system was around 650 We at the beginning of life, and
535 We after 43 days [6].

2.3 Russian space nuclear power systems
To date, the vast majority of Russian flight heritage of nuclear power systems in
space has stemmed from an extensive research and development program for space
reactor systems and hence very few missions have been augmented by RTG power. The
RORSAT ocean surveillance missions flown by the Soviet Union between 1971 and
1988 resulted in the launch of a total of 33 reactors in space, 30 of which successfully
reached orbit and were operated beyond start up.21
The first known reactor to have been flown by the Soviet Union was the BES-5
Buk design, launched on October 3rd 1970 under the Cosmos 367 mission. It is
understood that a total of 31 BES-5 Buk reactors were launched between 1970 and
1988 [9] although 3 units failed to launch successfully or failed after achieving orbit
[9]. Widespread public awareness of the Soviet space nuclear program was first made
on the 24th of January 1978 when fragments of the Cosmos 954 spacecraft and its BES-
5 reactor re-entered and crashed in the Alberta and Saskatchewan regions of northwest
Canada [10].
The BES-5 Buk reactor design was based around a core operating in the fast
neutron spectrum and fuelled by a highly enriched (95 Wt %) 235U-Mo alloy that was
cooled by a Sodium-potassium NaK loop. The NaK coolant was used to transfer the
thermal energy from the core to SiGe thermoelectric converters [11] and for heat
rejection to a conical radiator shroud below a shadow radiation shield [9]. Control of
the reactor was facilitated through the displacement of Beryllium control rods, which
served as both reflector and control mechanism. The electrical power output of the
BES-5 design was up to 3 kWe and had an operational lifetime of up to 6 months.22
Figure 2.10: Schematic diagrams of the BES-5 Buk reactor core design [9].
A later reactor design, TOPAZ addressed issues of safety and performance over
the BES-5 design. Fundamentally, the operation of the reactor was in the epithermal
neutron spectrum and the control system for the TOPAZ design utilized rotating
Beryllium control drums that were partially segmented with B4C to reduce the system
to a subcritical condition when rotated fully into the core. This control design change
reduced the risk of the system achieving criticality in the event of accidental impact.
The third major design change from the BES-5 design was that power conversion was
performed via in-core thermionic converters. A total of two TOPAZ reactors were
flown, the first was launched on the 1st of February 1987 on Cosmos 1818, the second
on the 10th of July 1987 onboard Cosmos 1867 [12].23
The TOPAZ design had a 5.5 kWe design output for up to 1 year, limited
mainly by the supply of caesium used in vapour form to neutralize inter electrode space
charge within the thermionic converters. The thermionic converters formed an integral
component of the fuel element structure, connected in series arrangements of 5 cells,
each surrounding individual highly enriched (96 wt%) 235UO2 fuel pellets. For this
reason, the fuel assemblies were refered to as Thermionic Fuel Elements (TFEs). A
total of 79 TFEs were arranged within the core, 60 of which provided power to the
spacecraft bus while 19 were used to power a linear electromagnetic induction pump
that was used to circulate NaK coolant from the core to a conical radiator. The
structure of the TOPAZ core consisted of 4 moderator disks composed of zirconium
hydride that were stacked axially and surrounded by a Be reflector and control drums.
Channels within the core structure allowed the TFEs to be loaded.

TOPAZ reactor design.23

A second variation of the TOPAZ design (TOPAZ-II / YENISEI) was produced
and although successfully ground tested, has not seen flight [13]. Several units were
sold to the United States for testing and evaluation but due to concern regarding launch
abort criticality issues with oceanic impacts, it was determined that NASA would not
fly the units.
The first Russian flights of RTG systems took place in 1965 and 1971 onboard
the Cosmos 84 and Cosmos 90 missions [14]. These initial devices named Orion-1 and
Orion-2 were fuelled by 210Po and provided 20 Watts of electrical power. In 1969 and
1971, two lunar rovers were launched by Russia under the Lunochod missions [14].
Both Lunochod rovers were heated by RHUs fuelled by a 210Po heat source with an
initial thermal loading of around 800 Watts each [14]. An RTG system was also
developed in 1978, again fuelled by a 210Po heat source, with a thermal loading of 600
Wth and an electrical power output of 40 We, but was never launched.
On the 16th of November 1996 the ill-fated Mars 96 mission began with a
launch from the Russian Baikonur facility. Mars 96 was an ambitious mission that set
out to land two surface science stations (soft landers) and two surface penetrators at
separate locations in the northern hemisphere of Mars. Both surface science stations
were powered by two RTGs fuelled by 238Pu. The Mars 96 spacecraft successfully
achieved an Earth parking orbit but after an anomalously short burn of the fourth stage
of the proton launch vehicle, the autonomous firing of the ‘Fregat’ transfer module
occurred, placing the spacecraft into an orbit that resulted in its re-entry into the earth’s
atmosphere over South America.25
Figure 2.12: 8.5 Wth ANGEL RHU/RTG
The RTGs flown on the Mars 96 mission were built around heat sources named
Angel units. These Angel RTG devices, built by BIOPAS under contract to the Red
Star Company, are the current design that is exploited by Russian space mission
designers and to date, some interest in their use has been generated within the European
Space Agency. The Angel RHUs have a thermal power output of 8.5 Watts and when
used as an RTG, provide an electrical power output of 0.15 Watts at 15 volts D.C. [15].
Since very little electrical power is generated by the Angel RTGs, it is implied that for
power production purposes, they should be used in conjunction with electrical batteries
as a trickle charge source.26
2.4 Current U.S. space radioisotope power technology
The general-purpose heat source radioisotope thermoelectric generator (GPHSRTG)
is an electrical power source that features an integrated modular heat source
design [16] (see Figure 3.2). Originally designed for and flown on the NASA Galileo
spacecraft, the GPHS-RTG was successfully used for the NASA Cassini mission and
more recently, the New Horizons Kuiper belt mission. The GPHS-RTG was originally
built by the US Department of Energy (DOE) at the Mound Laboratory in Miamisburg,
Ohio. As a result of increased security requirements and costs, the DOE closed the
Mound site. The responsibility for assembling RTGs was transferred to a new facility at
the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC). This was
completed prior to the production of the GPHS-RTG for the NASA New Horizons
mission that was launched in 2006.

cutaway schematic of the GPHS RTG - Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech.27
A general purpose heat source (GPHS) module is a composite carbon based
body that houses a total of four fuel pellets and as a whole acts as an aero-impact shell
and hence conforms to the UN resolution 47/68. The isotope fuel for the GPHS-RTG is
in the form of plutonium dioxide (238PuO2) at approximately 80% density. The fuel is
pressed into pellets with an approximate length and diameter of 27.6 mm [16]. Each
pellet has approximately 0.55 mm of iridium alloy (DOP-26) cladding [16] that is used
to maintain the structural integrity of the pellet both under normal operating conditions
and under impact. The iridium cladding also prevents the interaction of the source alpha
particles with materials with low atomic masses, which could produce neutrons via a-n
reactions. The internal structure of the GPHS module consists of two composite impact
shells covered by a carbon-bonded carbon sleeve. Each internal impact shell contains
two fuel pellets separated by a floating membrane [16]. The thermal power output of a
single fuel pellet is approximately 62.5 Wth [16]. GPHS Modules can be stacked
together and thermally coupled. The required electrical output power levels are
achieved through the appropriate selection of a number of GPHS modules incorporated
in a RTG system. The number of modules required is directly related to the power
conversion efficiency of the system. The current GPHS-RTG systems have a power
conversion efficiency of 6.5% to 7% and an overall system power density of 5.2 We kg-
1 [6] if a stack of 18 GPHS modules is used [16]. The thermoelectric junctions used for
power conversion by the GPHS-RTG are SiGe type junctions.28

Prior to any launch of a nuclear system or subsystem from the United States of
America, an established launch safety review and approval process must be undertaken.
It is the role of an interagency final review to make recommendations to the Office of
Science and Technology in the Office of the President of the United States. It is
anticipated that this procedure will remain effective throughout the foreseeable future
NPS programs.29
2.5 The plutonium climate
Much of the 238Pu fuel that is used within the GPHS-RTG systems is currently
supplied to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) by Russia in the form of 238PuO2
powder with an activity of between 12.6 Ci g-1 and 15.1 Ci g-2. 238Pu is manufactured by
the proton irradiation of 237Np or more industrially via the neutron irradiation of 237Np
in a high flux reactor. The latter is the more commonly used method and results in the
production of 238Np (half-life of 2.117 days), which decays via beta emission into 238Pu.
Current concerns over the availability of 238Pu [17, 18] that is of sufficient purity for
space applications have prompted the DOE to investigate the feasibility of establishing
a new production line in the US in order to meet the future needs of NASA [19]. One
proposal that has been established by Idaho National Laboratory has suggested the use
of the Advanced Test Reactor for the neutron irradiation of 237Np targets followed by
the chemical separation of the 238Pu via solvent extraction [20]. Other methods of
production suggested include the irradiation of neptunium targets in commercial power
reactors, but this presents lower production efficiencies and challenges in facility
licensing.
In 1976, President Ford issued a presidential directive to cease all reprocessing
of nuclear materials in the United States amidst a tense political climate regarding
nuclear proliferation after a successful Indian demonstration of weapons capabilities
derived from reprocessing technologies. President Carter reviewed and reaffirmed this
directive in 1977. In 1981, the U.S. ban on reprocessing was lifted by President Regan
but due to a lack of financial support from his government, restarting a reprocessing
program within the U.S. was not commercially viable. For this reason, a finite inventory30
of materials produced in the U.S. was created and through an agreement between the
U.S. and Russian governments, a limited supply of 238Pu to the U.S. was established.
Current concerns over the limited availability of suitably pure materials and the cost of
restarting the production of 238Pu [17] has increased the need to explore alternative
isotopes for these applications. Several alternative radioisotopes that are possible
solutions to the limited supply of 238Pu are presented and discussed throughout this
thesis. These include 241Am, 208Po and 210Po and 90Sr.
2.6 The Multi Mission RTG & Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator
In attempt to address the shortage of 238Pu in the short term, NASA, the U.S.
Department of Energy and their subcontractors have invested in the development of two
smaller, more versatile and efficient power source designs for space applications. These
designs, called the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG)
and the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), are both designed around
the currently serviced and approved GPHS module design but essentially use fewer
numbers of modules in each system to provide the desired output power.
The MMRTG for all intents and purposes is a smaller, more versatile derivation
of the GPHS-RTG that is capable of operating both in the vacuum of space and within
an atmosphere such as on the surface of planetary bodies. The heat source for the
system consists of a total of 8 GPHS modules developing a total of 2000 Watts of
thermal power and operate at 538 °C. These modules are surrounded by Pb-Te31
thermoelectric junctions which yield a total electrical power output of approximately
125 Watts. The remaining 1875 Watts of thermal power is rejected to the operating
environment or space via fins held at 210°C on the outside of the MMRTG casing. The
efficiency of the thermoelectric conversion for the MMRTG is dependant upon the
working pressure of the system, which in turn is selected to be compatible with the
operating environment. For use in deep space (vacuum), the MMRTG has a conversion
efficiency of 6.3 % and for operation on the surface of Mars, its efficiency is
approximately 6.2 %. Although these figures indicate a lower efficiency and lower
electrical output power than the GPHS-RTG, it is much more versatile in its application
and requires 55.6% less plutonium to be fully fuelled.
Figure 2.16: Top: schematic of the Multi-Mission RTG (MMRTG). Bottom: Schematic of the Mars
Science Laboratory rover powered by a single MMRTG. Images Courtesy of NASA/JPL.32
The first flight of an MMRTG system will be on board the NASA Mars Science
Laboratory (MSL) mission where a single unit will provide the required electrical
power for long duration operation of its rover on Mars. The use of an active heat
exchanger in the vicinity of the MMRTG outer casing which operates at around 210 °C,
allows for the radiated rejected heat from the power source to be used to maintain
electronic and mechanical subsystems at their required operational temperatures. The
MMRTG is currently in the final stages of flight qualification in preparation for the
launch of the MSL mission in 2011.
The Advanced Stirling Radioisotope generator (ASRG) is currently under the
development stages leading to a fully integrated engineering unit (EU) that is capable of
generating electrical power from electrically simulated nuclear decay heat input. The
final system will be based around two free piston Stirling converters produced under
contract for NASA by Sunpower incorporated, each thermally coupled via a mechanical
heat collector to an individual GPHS module and a common cold end heat rejection
chassis (see Figure 2.16) which uses fins to radiate heat away from the system. The
temperature difference of 580 degrees exists across the Stirling engine which results
from a heat source operating temperature of 640 °C and a heat rejection side
temperature of 60 °C. Under this thermal operating regime, each Stirling converter
produces approximately 73 Watts of electrical power resulting in a total system
electrical power output of approximately 145 Watts. The free piston Stirling converters
operate linearly and resonate at around 105 Hz, and so as to minimize the effect of this
motion and hence dampen the system, both converters operate in phase but are
mechanically mounted at 180° to one another for mutual opposition of motion (see
Figure 2.16 Top).33
Figure 2.17: Top: Schematic of the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator. Bottom Left: Sunpower
inc. free piston Stirling engine. Bottom Right: Thermo-mechanical interface for free piston Stirling
engine. Images courtesy of NASA.
The efficiency of the free piston Stirling converter engine is limited to the
Carnot efficiency and the efficiency of the linear dynamo that is integral to the
converter design. The overall efficiency of each converter is between 27 % - 30 %.
Little can be done to improve on these figures but thermal losses throughout the system
can be combated to result in a system that is close to its theoretical efficiency.34
Ongoing work conducted by the NASA Glenn Research Center and Sunpower
inc. is establishing the life expectancy for the ASRG. Given that the ASRG has several
high frequency moving components that are subjected to physical wear and thermal
stress, it is expected that the lifetime of such units may not match those of RTG
systems. For this reason, it is reasonable to accept the necessity for both types of system
where an acceptable trade-off between efficiency and lifetime cannot be made by
mission planners. Table 2.1 below highlights the comparison between both the ASRG
and the MMRTG.

2.7 The European Space Agency
To date, the European Space Agency has not built or launched its own nuclear
power or heating systems. Instead, through its involvement and partnership in NASA
missions such as Cassini-Huygens the agency has had experience in space system
design that has exploited RTG and RHU technologies. The Huygens probe schematic
below depicts the use of a total of 34 Light Weight Radioisotope Heater Units
(LWRHUs) [21, 22] that were provided to NASA by the U.S. Department of Energy for
integration prior to launch at Cape Canaveral with the Huygens probe structure.
Figure 2.18 – Schematic of the ESA’s Huygen’s Probe showing the location of all 34 LWRHUs/
During the mid 1990s, the European space agency explored the option of
purchasing Angel RHUs and RTGs from the Russian government as part of a
technology exchange program [15]. The discussions explored the purchase of flight
qualified 8.5Wth units in addition to the development of a 50 Wth RHU but to date have36
not been successful, despite recent interest in the use of 8.5 Wth units under the
ExoMars rover mission. At the time of writing, it is anticipated that the ExoMars rover
will utilise between 3 and 8 Light Weight RHUs supplied by the U.S. Department of
Energy under a technology transfer agreement between the European Space Agency
and NASA.
In order to develop its own capability in RHU and RPS technologies, the
European Space Agency has begun a series of technical evaluations and feasibility
studies in related fields as the author completes this thesis. Through formal
contributions and informal discussions with the ESA program staff, the results from this
thesis and the author’s related work is helping to answer key questions regarding
radioisotope encapsulation, selection and availability that will be used to define the
ESA strategy and developmental roadmap.

2.9 Nuclear thermal propulsion
In any rocket propulsion system, the thrust generated by a given engine
design is related to the mass and velocity at which propellants are exhausted
through a nozzle per unit time. This relationship is defined by Equation 2.1. In a
chemical rocket engine, the heat of combustion results in the excitation of
typically gaseous combustion products to a velocity referred to in the context of
rocket propulsion as the characteristic velocity c*. The physical design of a rocket
engine is driven by its operating environment and most significantly, the nozzle is
used to maximise the exhaust velocity. This optimisation is achieved through
expansion of the exhaust down to a pressure as close to the external
environmental pressure as is practically achievable. The gain in performance and
thus exhaust velocity is represented by the introduction of a coefficient of thrust
CR. For derivation of the coefficient of thrust and its relationship to rocket nozzle
design, the author directs the reader to the published works by Turner [23] and
Sutton [24].

Equation 2.2: The exhaust velocity of a rocket engine as a function of the characteristic velocity
c* and the coefficient of thrust CR [24].42
Through conservation of energy, the characteristic velocity of the
propellants obtained in a combustion chamber is related most fundamentally to
the molecular mass and temperature of the exhaust [23]. This is defined in
Equation 2.3. Clearly, for a fixed gas product, the greatest performance can be
achieved though the maximisation of the operating temperature of the rocket
engine and by using an exhaust product with a low molecular mass.

Equation 2.3: Characteristic velocity of the exhaust from a rocket engine as a function of the
exhaust molecular mass M, ratio of specific heats ?, gas constant R` and the engine chamber
temperature Tc [23].
When discussing the efficiency of a rocket propulsion system, the
efficiency is often conveyed as a value called the specific impulse Isp. The specific
impulse is related to the exhaust velocity as derived in Equation 2.4. Thus, a
system with a greater exhaust velocity will be more efficient in terms of Isp. A
word of caution is however offered by the author, since in practice one must
consider losses in an orbital system due to gravity. For example, although a
propulsion system may have a large exhaust velocity and hence a large Isp, it may
yield a very low thrust and therefore for some applications, its use may be
precluded by large gravity losses due to extended propulsive operation to achieve
a given velocity change. This may be illustrated by a typical electric propulsion
system. For this reason, a propulsion system that is to be used for multiple
applications, i.e. both on orbit or surface to orbit transfers, should deliver a
suitable level of thrust while producing a suitably large specific impulse. In
context, the best theoretical performance delivered by a chemical propulsion43
system that uses Liquid oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen as propellants is a specific
impulse of around 389.5 seconds [24].

Earth’s surface.
The Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NTR) engine was developed as a propulsion
system that could achieve higher efficiencies (Isp) than can be achieved by
chemical propulsion systems while being capable of delivering usable thrust for
on orbit transfer in large fields of gravitational influence over short periods of
time. The concept of NTP relies on the excitation of a propellant by provision of
heat from the core of a nuclear fission reactor. Since the propellant characteristic
velocity is related to both its molecular mass and operating temperature, a low
mass propellant is highly desirable while the reactor core temperature should be
driven to very high temperatures. The thermodynamic properties of the propellant
should also be considered, in particular the ratio of specific heats since its
magnitude is proportional to the magnitude of the characteristic velocity as
described in Equation 2.3. It should of course be noted that non-combustible
propellants can be selected for operation of NTP systems which may allow for a
reduction in storage requirements, overall mass and mission cost. However,
careful consideration must be made during propellant selection for material and
chemical compatibility at high temperatures. As an example, oxidisers or pure44
oxygen is not suitable for use as a propellant since this would be likely to cause
combustion of the core structure. Table .1 identifies some potentially suitable
propellants that can be used in a nuclear thermal propulsion system.

Between 1955 and 1972, the United States built and performed in excess
of twenty NTR engine tests under the Rover and NERVA programs. The
Rover/NERVA tests demonstrated specific impulses of around 850 seconds and
thrust levels between 111 kN and 1.11 MN [26]. The U.S. programs also
demonstrated that operation in excess of two hours and the ability to execute
multiple re-starts is achievable using reactors using the thermal neutron spectrum
via self-moderating graphite based fuel designs [27]. Two fuel designs were
developed and tested extensively for their lifetime and compatibility within the45
NTR environments. The first fuels developed under the Rover program utilised a
composite dispersion of metallic 235U within a graphite element matrix. Such fuels
were found to be susceptible to migration of fuel at high temperatures through
pores and voids within the matrix. In the second type, fuel particles coated within
a pyro-carbon cladding were distributed within a graphite matrix in an attempt to
prevent migration of fuel throughout the general matrix. These two fuel types are
illustrated in Figure 2.20 below.

Building upon its extensive experience in space reactor design and
operation, the Soviet Union also conducted a series of fuel tests for NTR systems
within the IGR and EWG-1 research reactors in Kazakhstan. Figure 2.5 (right)
illustrates in-core experimentation with UC-ZrC-NbC and UC-ZrC-C fuel forms
within the EWG-1 reactor. The Soviet tests culminated in the operation of a 36 kN
thruster of the RD-0140 design [29] (11B91 – IGRIT) on the 27th March 1978
[30]. A photograph of the IGRIT engine is illustrated Figure 2.5 (left). A design
for a 392 kN thruster was also prepared during the Soviet research program [29]
although production of a full scale prototypic unit is not confirmed.47

‘Twisted-Ribbon’ fuel elements as tested within the EWG-1 research reactor [29].
In practice, propellant is injected into the reactor core at a velocity that is
specific to the system design, typically via turbo machinery. Fundamentally, the
injection velocity (vinj) is driven by mass flow rate (m-dot), total cross sectional
area of the flow channels (ACSF) and propellant injection density (?inj). Equation
2.5 expresses this relationship. In basic analyses of NTR systems, the injection
velocity is commonly ignored but its neglect gives rise to error in the effective
exhaust velocity that is achieved by a given system. Thus, the effective exhaust
velocity may be estimated through adaptation of Equation 2.2 via the summation
of the propellant injection velocity and the characteristic velocity, which may be
considered to be a velocity increment due to heating within the core. An
estimation of the NTR effective exhaust velocity is presented in Equation 2.7.

2.10 Tungsten core power and propulsion reactors
The overall efficiency of any nuclear fission power and propulsion system
is limited most fundamentally by the efficiency of the heat transfer from fuel to
propellant within the core and the thermal power density of the fuel elements.
Similarly, the successful fabrication, operational performance and safety of
reactor fuels for space power and propulsion applications is clearly driven by the
fabrication techniques and materials adopted. Under the Rover/NERVA
programs, the NTR reactor cores comprised of carbon-based fuel elements in
which fuel materials were dispersed within graphite matrices (see Figure 5.2
Bottom). The most efficient propellant for NTR systems is hydrogen when
consideration is given to specific impulse (See Table 5.1). Unfortunately,
hydrogen is highly erosive to graphite structures at elevated temperatures and
under turbulent flow. Efforts were made to reduce the effect of hot hydrogen
erosion through the provision of protective claddings during the Rover program,
but these efforts did not completely eliminate the problem. Figure 5.10 illustrates
the mass loss rate as a function of axial position. It was noted that a region known
as the mid-band axial position experienced the greatest mass loss rates49
irrespective of fuel composition. This mid-band region corresponded to the
position of greatest temperature gradient and thus thermal stresses are believed to
have caused fracture points. The brittleness of carbon-based fuel elements is an
inherent problem for operational safety and containment during accident scenarios
involving impact and the ease of material extraction from the carbon matrix
presents several non-proliferation issues.
Figure 5.10: Mass loss from Pewee and NF-1 NTR reactors tested under the Rover/NERVA
programs. Mass loss is presented as a function of axial position and reactor environment. The peak
in the mass loss curve is the so-called midband or midrange corrosion. The best performance was
obtained from the composite fuels coated with zirconium carbide (ZrC). [31]
Tungsten has a greater thermal conductivity than that of graphite, a high
melting point, and is more resistant to creep deformation at elevated temperatures.
Tungsten is also more resistant to fuel migration within its matrix and is more
resistant to physical changes induced by radiation, such as neutron absorption
[32]. It has been shown that fission product gases released within a tungstencermet
matrix can be effectively contained for temperatures up to 1550ºC [33].
Thus, tungsten cermet fuels are likely to be more compatible to the hot hydrogen
operating conditions within an NTR core [25].50
Unlike the fuels developed for the Rover/NERVA program, tungsten
cermet based fuels must be operated within the fast neutron spectrum. When
compared to reactors operating in the thermal neutron spectrum, fast spectrum
reactors are less susceptible to reactivity degradation with respect to an increase in
fission product inventory over time due to the relatively low neutron absorption
cross sections of abundant fission products at high energies. Thus, it is anticipated
that a fast spectrum NTR will have longer reactivity and materials durability
lifetimes than those of themal spectrum systems with graphite fuel matrices.
Previous space reactor programs such as the Argonne National Laboratory
(ANL) rocket program and the General Electric 710 (GE-710) program have
investigated the use of uranium dioxide encased in tungsten and tungsten-rhenium
matrices (cermet fuels) in order to eliminate the problems associated with graphite
based fuels [34]. Both programs proved the viability of encasing UO2 in both a
tungsten and tungsten-rhenium matrix using hot press sintering techniques with
varying levels of success. Both programs also revealed that oxygen atoms
dissociated from the uranium at the high sintering and operational temperatures,
which formed volatiles such as WO2 and WO3. In order to mitigate the formation
of tungsten oxides, ThO2 and GdO1.5 were added to the fuel in order to suppress
the effective dissociation at temperature by increasing the probability for oxygen
recombination. The fuel elements were formed in a volume ratio of 60%UO2-
34%W-6%GdO1.5 or 6%ThO2. The uranium was enriched to 93 wt% 235U and the
GE-710 program mixed the tungsten into a 75 wt% W - 25 wt% Re alloy to
increase the ductility [35].51
Further enhancements of the tungsten-cermet fuel can be made using
various tungsten-compatible additives. Rhenium and molybdenum can be added
to the tungsten to reduce the brittleness and improve the toughness of the metal
matrix. The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature is also adjusted through the
addition of these materials. To reduce migration of fission product and fuel
inventory, the grain boundaries of the ceramics can also be modified by the
addition of thoria (ThO2) or gadolinium oxide Gd2O3 which act as stabilizers.
The mechanical properties of refractory alloy cermet fuel elements may
allow for the safe operation at high temperatures resulting in NTR systems with
large specific impulses while maintaining integrity and capture of nuclear fuels
during exposure to hot hydrogen environments. Likewise, refractory alloy fuel
elements provide resistance against the high temperatures experienced during
atmospheric re-entry and impacts associated with launch failures and spaceflight
accidents, while providing inherent physical security and resistance to extraction
by pyrolysis or direct pyrotechnic dispersion of fuel materials. The 710 program
demonstrated excellent promise for refractory alloy fuels, but the high
temperatures experienced by the fuel materials during cermet fabrication via hot
isostatic pressing likely contributed to containment failures in some fuel elements
through the reduction of the fuel compounds and allowing for the migration of
liquid uranium metal throughout the tungsten matrices prior to the closure of the
tungsten pores during sintering. The localized formation of tungsten oxides may
also have presented mechanical weaknesses within some of the fuel cermets.52
Work undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
attempted to reduce volatilization and reduction of the fuels during high
temperature sintering by pre-coating the fuel particles in the same material as the
matrix of choice (tungsten) using a spheridisation process [36]. However, the
fundamental problems attributed to hot press sintering of cermets resulted in
significant grain growth, and thus a lower than theoretical matrix strength was
attained.
The volumetric fraction of the fuel materials to be encapsulated within a
cermet as discussed in section 5.4 is an influential factor attributed to the material
properties such as strength and fuel migration and the overall amount of material
that can be released to the external environment in the event of fracture, which, in
the case of the nuclear thermal rocket is the hydrogen propellant stream. The
effective critical mass of a tungsten cermet core is also dependant upon the
volumetric loading of the fuel elements. To demonstrate this relationship, a model
of the Pewee NTR core was created using the MCNP Monte Carlo radiation
transport code and its graphite based 235U composite fuel was substituted with
tungsten cermets of varied fuel-tungsten volumetric ratios. The Rover/NERVA
Pewee engine was selected for modelling due to the availability of a large
inventory of design data to the author and colleagues at the Center for Space
Nuclear Research at Idaho National Laboratory. Uranium Nitride (235UN) was
selected as the fuel compound due to its stability under neutron irradiation and a
matrix of pure tungsten was assumed. Details and cross sectional diagram of the
MCNP model adopted for the study are presented in Figure 5.11. Figure 5.1253
illustrates the results for the Monte Carlo modelling of the cermet Pewee core
effective k value as a function of volumetric ratio of uranium nitride to tungsten.
Figure 5.11: Cross sectional view of the MCNP model used in the determination of criticality or
effective k value for a tungsten cermet fuelled Rover/NERVA Pewee engine. Here a core of 27 cm
diameter composed of UN-tungsten cermet fuel elements equal to the Rover/NERVA fuel
geometry is surrounded by a beryllium reflector and a total of 8 control drums segmented with a
B4C neutron absorber.

tungsten-uranium nitride cermet elements as a function of volumetric fuel loading between 25%
and 50% UN.
Launch Safety is a significant contributing factor that should be
considered within the design of any fission reactor that is built for space
applications. Reactor cores that are designed to operate in the thermal neutron
spectrum are more susceptible to uncontrolled criticality during accidental
submersion into fresh or sea water due to reflection and in the case of water
infiltration, enhancement of moderation [25, 26]. This was also considered to be a54
limiting factor for the use of the Topaz II reactor system purchased from the
former Soviet Union by NASA in the 1990’s [37] which led to unimplemented
design modification efforts prior to the cancellation of the US program. Monte
Carlo modelling using MCNP [38] of fast reactor systems undertaken by the
author in collaboration with J.D. Bess at the Center for Space Nuclear Research
revealed that a tungsten based fast reactor is unlikely to achieve criticality in
accidental submersion events with the exception of intact impact into wet silica
sands [25]. When considering core lifetime, launch safety and proliferation
resistance, it is apparent that fast spectrum tungsten cermet reactors offer a greater
solution than equivalent graphite based thermal reactors such as those used in the
Rover/NERVA program.
2.11 Thermal analysis of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion
Within the frame of reference for the reactor core of an NTR propulsion
system, the propellant acts as a coolant and thus the operating power output of the
core must be equal to the rate at which heat can be removed from the system
including thermal losses. Figure 2.2 (Top) illustrates fuel element assemblies that
were developed during the Rover/NERVA Nuclear Thermal Rocket programs in
the US. In the Rover/NERVA designs, several (19) propellant flow channels are
integral to the structure of each fuel element. Careful design of the propellant flow
channels should facilitate efficient heat transfer between the fuel and the
propellant/coolant. Equation 2.8 relates the total power removed by a singlephase
propellant heated to a hot temperature by difference ?T. A system which
uses a propellant that undergoes a phase change during operation must also55
provide sufficient power and hence energy equivalent to the latent heat in addition
to the power required to elevate the propellant temperature.
€
P =m
•
cp?T (2.8)
Equation 2.8: Power that must be extracted from the core of an NTR by a propellant raised in
temperature by ?T with a mass flow rate m-dot and specific heat capacity cp.
If we consider the axial temperature distribution of a simple core design
with a uniform fission power distribution, the region closest to the propellant inlet
will be cooler than the region closest to the exit. This can be demonstrated
through detailed analysis of heat transfer between the core and the propellant. In
practice, this axial temperature gradient across the core can be minimised by
manufacturing a core with a suitable axial power distribution by varying the fuel
loading concentrations with respect to position.
Maximisation of heat transfer to the propellant within the core of an NTR
engine is facilitated by forced convection via turbulent flow through flow
channels within individual fuel elements. Estimation of the heat transferred to the
propellant from the walls to the propellant may be made through the consideration
of the heat transfer coefficient, h (W m-2 K-1) and the total surface area (ASFC) of
flow channels within the NTR core. The rate at which thermal energy may be
transferred in bulk from core to propellant is therefore estimated in Equation 2.9.
It should be noted that the log mean value of the temperature difference is used
since the value of the heat transfer coefficient varies with respect to temperature
due to the temperature dependency of the thermo-physical properties of the
propellant.56
€
P = ASFC?TLog-Mean ( ) dh
dt
(2.9)
Equation 2.9: Power that is transferred from the core of an NTR to a propellant raised in
temperature by ?T, where h is the heat transfer coefficient and ASFC is the total surface area of the
propellant flow channels.
In the case of the nuclear rocket engine, the heat transfer coefficient (h) is
governed by the thermal conductivity of the propellant, which varies in practice as
a function of temperature, and is enhanced by the overall dominance of the
turbulent flow. The unit-less Nusselt number (?) may be used to quantify the ratio
of convective to conductive heat transfer between the inside wall of the flow
channel and the propellant. Since the heat varies across the entire diameter of the
flow channel, this must be accounted for by consideration of the hydraulic
diameter. The hydraulic diameter DH is not equal to the diameter of the flow
channel for complex channel geometries since it is related to the wetted region in
which fluid flows. In the case of a circular cross section, the DH is however equal
to the channel diameter (2r) as shown in Equation 2.10. The dependency of the
heat transfer coefficient to the thermal conductivity, hydraulic diameter and
Nusselt number is presented in Equation 2.11 for dimensional analyses of NTR
propellant systems.

Estimation of the heat transfer coefficient (h) may be made for forced
convection conditions via turbulent flow by implementation of the Dittus-Boelter
correlation, which relates the Nusselt Number (?) to the Prandtl number (Pr) and
the Reynolds (Re) number. In the case of an NTR propellant where the fluid is
acting as a coolant, the value of n in the Dittus-Boelter correlation was found to
be 0.3. It is understood that for a fluid that acts to heat a tube through which it
flows, the value of n is equal to 0.4. The Dittus-Boelter correlation is presented in
Equation 2.12 below.
€
? = 0.023Re

n (2.12)
Equation 2.12: The Dittus-Boelter correlation for the Nusselt number (?) with respect to the
Reynolds number Re, Prandtl number Pr. In the case of an NTR propellant, n = 0.3.
The Reynolds Number (Re) is a dimensionless ratio of a fluid’s inertial
forces (?v2/DH) to viscous forces (µV/DH
2) [39]. Through empirical evaluations of
the Reynolds Number, it is understood that the onset of turbulent flow within
circular flow channels may be observed where Re = ~ 2.3×103 [40]. Thus, in
preliminary flow channel design, the hydraulic diameter must be engineered such
that turbulent flow exists throughout the axial profile.

Equation 2.13: The Reynolds number for a propellant of density ?(T,P), kinematic viscosity
?(T,P) and dynamic viscosity µ(T,P) travelling through a channel with hydraulic diameter DH at a
velocity V.58
The Prandtl number provides a numerical ratio of the momentum
diffusivity or kinematic viscosity to the thermal diffusivity within a turbulent
fluid. This may in turn be related to the thermal conductivity of the fluid.
Equation 2.14 presents this relationship to the Prandtl number.

Equation 2.14: The Prandtl Number Pr with respect to kinematic viscosity ?(T,P) and thermal
diffusivity (a) of the propellant. Also presented is its relationship to specific heat capacity cp(T).
Clearly, a basic estimation of the flow channel design can be determined
by implementation of Equations 2.9 to 2.14 from a given set of start conditions.
However, such a model may be considered somewhat inaccurate for practical
system design purposes due to the temperature and pressure dependency of the
thermo-physical properties used to estimate the heat transfer coefficient. In
practice, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) code such as Ansys [41] or Comsol must be used.
To date, the principal of nuclear thermal propulsion has been demonstrated
through the extensive ground testing performed in the U.S. and in Russia. The
results from these tests highlighted significant operational time dependant failures
in the integrity of fuel forms that were historically adopted. Radiological
contamination of the propellant as it exited the nozzle of the engine was observed
during these tests [27]. Such failure of fuel matrices is not desirable for
operational lifetime or for safety. One possible solution to the problems with the
traditional graphite fuel forms is proposed and discussed in Chapter 6.59

Current radioisotope heat source encapsulation technology
In this chapter, two unclassified radioisotope heat source assemblies produced in
the United States are described: the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) Module with
a thermal power output of 250 W [1] and the Light Weight Radioisotope Heating Unit
(LWRHU), with a thermal output power of 1 W [2]. The 8 W heat source known as
Angel [3], which is produced in Russia, is similar in design to the LWRHU [2] is also
discussed. The fundamental elements of these heat sources rely on the use of 238Pu
encapsulated in a refractory cladding and surrounded by a composite insulator and
ablative liner/impact aeroshell assembly.
In accordance with UN resolution 47/68, all radioisotope heat sources for use in
space must be capable of preventing the dispersal of nuclear materials into the Earth’s
environment during nominal and accidental situations. For this reason, careful
engineering of the radioisotope containment must be ensured. In today’s climate where
global terrorism is a serious threat, the preservation of security for nuclear materials is
essential at all stages of production and under all possible conditions. When considering
operational temperatures and temperatures achieved under extreme conditions such as
launch failure and atmospheric re-entry scenarios which include orbit decay and
minimum angle of attack, , it is also important to select a radioisotope encapsulation
technique or material that will prevent the dispersal of the enclosed nuclear materials
under such conditions.63
3.1 The General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS)

The General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) was primarily designed to provide
heat in a power generation system and consited of 18 modules stacked to form the core
of these RTGs. The required thermal power level for any system can be achieved by
coupling modules in multiples of 250 Wth. The fuel used to form the GPHS fuel pellets
is 238PuO2. The GPHS fuel pellets are produced and clad in iridium alloy DOP-26 at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory and shipped, for assembly into the GPHS modules, at
the Idaho National Laboratory. The geometry of each fuel pellet is cylindrical (2.76 ±
0.02 cm diameter by 2.76 ± 0.024 cm long) with a chamfer at each end [4]. The GPHS
fuel pellets are produced from a purified powdered feedstock of PuO2 with an assay of
82.2 % 238Pu by weight [4].64
The feedstock materials are purified via an aqueous recovery process that can
accept an input of impure source materials or existing PuO2 that may be in an oxidation
state (such as IV+) that does not conform to requirements for use in the GPHS
architecture. Before starting pellet production, the feedstock chemical form and grain
size must conform to specific requirements. In recent years, the 238PuO2 purchased by
the United States from Russia for use in radioisotope power systems has been of the
form of 238PuO2 (IV+). The final stages of the aqueous processing involves the
production of Pu3+ Oxalate [5] which undergoes calcination in the presence of oxygen
that is enriched in 16O [6]. The resultant feedstock material is 238PuO2 (III+), the
compound that has been qualified for safe operation during accident scenarios. The
feedstock must be processed via ball milling to produce particle sizes < 250 µm, 60% of
which is sintered at 1100 °C while 40% is sintered at 1600 °C. The granules of PuO2 are
sintered at the respective temperatures for 6 hours in a platinum boat in an argon
atmosphere saturated with H2
16O or in a mixed reaction gas consisting of argon and
16O2 [5]. This reaction cover gas is produced by the passing of argon gas through a
liquid H2
16O bubbler followed by purification in a tube furnace containing titanium
beads held at 750 °C [7]. The granules sintered at 1600 °C have a larger average size
than those sintered at 1100 °C. This is due to grain growth enhancement at the higher
temperatures. The density of these grains is in excess of 95% of the theoretical density.
This sintering process ensures that the correct grain size and morphology of the
feedstock is achieved prior to hot pressing of the fuel pellets. This process also
facilitates the displacement of 17O and 18O based plutonia which produce a-n neutrons
[8]. The two powders (containing different average grain sizes) are blended together in
a 40large grain : 60small grain ratio for pellet pressing. This morphology and mixture ratio has65
been empirically determined to provide the required pellet bulk density (approximately
85 % of the theoretical density). The final pellet is also resistant to shrinkage and
cracking during fabrication, a property attributed to the fraction of the dense powder
grains that are sintered at the higher temperature.
Pellet production is achieved by hot pressing 151 g of PuO2 feedstock in a
graphite die, with an average force of 12.4 kN, at a temperature of 1500 °C - 1525 °C
for 28 minutes [5]. This translates into a pressure of approximately 20.7 MPa. The
pellet produced by this hot press process is reduced to a stoichiometry of PuO1.93 by
reactions with the graphite during the sintering process. Before the pellet can be used,
an oxidation stage is required to restore its stoichiometry to PuO2. This is achieved by
pressureless sintering of the hot pressed pellet in a platinum boat filled with powdered
Thoria. This process is carried out in an argon 16O2 enriched atmosphere. The addition
of Thoria to the platinum boat stage is used to support the pellet and prevent the
generation of pressure stress points in the pellet that may arise from its own weight and
the direct placement of the pellet in the platinum boat. Two stages of the pressureless
sintering are performed, firstly at 1000 °C for 6 hours followed by a period of 6 hours at
1527 °C [5, 7]. This final post-press sintering increases the grain sizes of residual
submicron plutonium oxide fines to a size of ~20 to ~30 µm [5], which minimises the
production of respirable fine particles in the event of impacts associated with launch
accidents. The resultant fuel pellets have an average density of 9.89 g.cm-3 [4] and are
capable of capturing radiogenic helium during pre-assembly and storage but expand at
operational temperatures (extreme re-entry temperatures) increasing the porosity and
enabling the venting of trapped helium.66

Following production, each fuel pellet used in the GPHS architecture is
individually encapsulated in a vented iridium alloy (DOP-26) clad. The wall thickness
on the GPHS fuel clad is 0.73 mm [10]. The cladding is assembled from two pieces
(manufactured by Oak Ridge National Laboratory): a vented cup and a shield cup. The67
vented cup features a vent hole that is filtered by a sintered iridium frit (porous matrix)
that allows radiogenic helium to escape without affecting the containment of fine
displaced PuO2 particles in the event of an accident or impact [10]. The iridium frit is
produced by sintering 0.0725 g of iridium powder to 67% theoretical density [10],
which allows helium to flow through it at a rate of 4.5 to 7.5 cm3/min at a feed pressure
of 7 kPa [10]. The vent assembly has a thickness no greater than 0.41 mm and is
produced by the diffusion bonding of a cover disc that is vented to the interior of the
clad and a backing disc that is vented to the exterior of the clad over the iridium frit
[10] (see Figure 3.4). For pre-assembly storage and transport of the fuelled clads, an
iridium contamination cover blister is applied to the exterior of the vent during the
manufacturing of clads. This is only removed immediately prior to the final assembly of
a GPHS module. The purpose of the cover blister is to reduce the probability of
contamination by plutonium oxide fines during shipping and storage prior to module
assembly. The lower half of the cladding consists of the shield cup that includes a 0.127
mm thick iridium foil between the ceramic PuO2 pellet and the joint between the two
halves of the cladding [11]. This shield isolates the plutonium dioxide fuel pellet and is
essential for the prevention of material volatilization during the welding process that
seals the two halves of the cladding together [11]. Tungsten inert gas welding with a
Hobart welder is used to join the two halves of the iridium cladding [11]. This is an arc
welding process that is conducted in an inert argon environment to prevent the
contamination of the welds by airborne impurities. This is important since such
impurities may lead to long term corrosion and may weaken the overall strength of the
weld.68

Completed GPHS fuel clads are installed into a Fine Weave Pierced Fabric
(FWPF) Graphite Impact Shell (GIS) in pairs. The two sealed heat sources housed in a
GIS are separated by a porous FWPF floating membrane that allows the precise69
positioning of each heat source for optimum thermal performance while allowing a vent
path for radiogenic gases. The Purpose of the GIS is to provide protection from impacts
caused by atmospheric re-entry or launch vehicle accidents. Both ends of the GIS are
vented by multiple holes to prevent helium retention. One end of the GIS features a
threaded opening that is closed by a cap. See Figure 3.1.
A thin walled insulator manufactured by Oak Ridge National Laboratory [14]
comprising of a Carbon Bonded Carbon Fibre (CBCF) sleeve and two thin CBCF disks
is used to envelop each GIS in order to insulate it and the fuel from severe effects of
brief temperature excursions during worst case re-entry conditions [4, 15]. The CBCF
insulator ensures that the temperature in the GIS is greater than 800 °C such that the
ductility of the fuel cladding is preserved in the event of a post re-entry impact [4]. The
CBCF sleeve and disks have a thickness of 1 mm [16] and an average thermal
conductivity of 0.059 W m-1 K-1 [16]. The CBCF sleeve is not gas-tight so as to allow
radiogenic helium to escape under normal operational conditions [4]. The CBCF sleeve
is occasionally referred to as the Post Impact Containment Shell (PICS) since it offers
some degree of containment of fine isotope powder grains in the event of a ruptured
clad [17].
The final stage of a GPHS module assembly involves the insertion of two
fuelled GIS/PICS assemblies into a single square block aeroshell. The aeroshell is made
from FWPF and provides an ablative barrier from the high temperatures experienced
during atmospheric re-entry events and flash fire accidents, while providing good
thermal conductivity between the heat source and a power conversion system. The
GIS/PICS assemblies are secured inside the two separate cavities in the aeroshell by70
means of a threaded aeroshell cap. A locking screw is used to prevent the loosening of
the aeroshell cap [4]. With the exception of the CBCF insulator and FWPF billets
produced by Textron Products Inc., all of the components for the aeroshell and GIS
assembly are manufactured at Idaho National Laboratory.
The GPHS modules are designed and qualified to withstand impacts at a
velocity of 55 m s-1 and a clad temperature of 970 °C [17], which is a predicted post reentry
temperature for a module having reached a peak temperature of 1740 °C [18].
Computational fluid dynamics modelling has been used to determine that sub-orbital
accidental re-entries could result in the ablation of between 0.28 mm and 1.37 mm of
the outer surface of the module, whereas re-entries due to orbit decay are predicted to
result in an ablation of 1.37 mm [4]. The most severe re-entry temperatures are reached
by very low angle (?) re-entry profiles such as super-orbital near skip-out (? = - 5.3°)
and multiple skip re-entry (? < - 5.3°) [19], where the final re-entry interface occurs
below the skip-out boundary [4]. A re-entry interface is commonly defined as the point
at which contact is made between an object with a velocity less than the orbital velocity
for its current position makes contact with the atmosphere of a planet. Calculations
have shown that typical ablation for these two scenarios is 1.73 mm and 3.30 mm
respectively [4].71
Module qualification testing included:
• ageing tests [18]
• testing resistance to fire [18]
• ablation [19]
• impact [4, 18, 20].
• vibration testing [18]
• explosion overpressurisation tests [4, 21]
• edge on flyer plate testing [4, 22]

7°), intermediate angle (20° < a >7°) and steep (90° < a > 20°) re-entry interface angles of attack. Also
plotted is a typical ballistic re-entry vehicle velocity profile and the point of maximum heating for the
GPHS modules coincident on the minimum interface angle boundary [4].
During the U.S. Defence Nuclear Agency’s “Direct Course” test, in which 554
Metric Tons [23] of Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO) liquid explosive were used to
simulate the effects of a 1 kT tactical nuclear weapon, the General Electric Advanced72
Energy Programs Department deployed a parallel experiment in which a simulated
GPHS-RTG was subjected to pressures similar to those that would be experienced by
the explosion of a launch vehicle carrying such a generator [23, 24]. Pressure
transducers measured an incident overpressure of around 10.3 MPa at the GPHS-RTG
simulator. Most significantly, the GPHS modules were entirely destroyed and
fragments of iridium and graphite were strewn several hundreds to thousands of feet
away from the experimental setup [23]. Approximately 70 percent of the fragments
from the four iridium fuel clads from the flight model GPHS module that was loaded
into the experimental setup were located after the tests by members of the Nuclear
Emergency Search Team (NEST). This was made possible by the pre-test irradiation of
the Ir fuel clads containing depleted UO2 at the Los Alamos Omega West Reactor to
produce 192Ir. The result obtained by the Direct Course experiment highlights the
potential susceptibility of the GPHS architecture to explosive destruction and dispersal
of radioisotope materials.

the ‘Direct Course’ explosion test [23].73
The Fine Weave Pierced Fabric (FWPF) used for the GIS and ablative aeroshell
components is fabricated from a feedstock of Ultra High Modulus carbon fibre strands
made commercially by Hexcel as product UHM-1K PAN (polyacrylonitrile) Carbon
Fibre [14]. The AVCO division of Textron Products Inc. of Anaheim, California is
responsible for the production of FWPF billets beyond feedstock[14]. The UHM-1K
fibres are woven into a fine sheet and placed into a support cradle. Depending on the
size of the required finished billet of FWPF, multiple layers (typically many thousand)
are stacked and compressed. Once under compression a piercing device composed of
many hundreds of ~ 1 mm diameter needles (rods) is driven through the compressed
stack of weaves. Once pierced, the needles are replaced by carbon-phenolic rods [25].
At this point in the fabrication process, known as perform, the density of the assembly
is on average 0.85 g/cm3 [25]. In order to make the pierced stack rigid, 15V coal-tar
pitch oil [25] is driven into the structure under pressure prior to a bake out cycle under
atmospheric pressure at a temperature that is proprietary to Textron. The average
density for billets post rigidization is 1.047 g/cm3 [25]. On completion of this initial
rigidization process, the billets are subjected to a 5-cycle densification process
performed by ATK (originally by the General Electric Company). This process uses the
same 15V coal-tar pitch oil driven into the billet under hot isostatic conditions [25].
This process is called Hot Isostatic Pressure Impregnation Carbonisation (HIPIC) and
each cycle involves the injection of pitch oil at pressures of approximately 1.01 MPa
[25] and at temperatures that are, as in the case of the Textron process, proprietary. It is
understood that this application of heat during impregnation is to reduce the viscosity of
the 15 V coal-tar pitch oil so as to facilitate uniform penetration of the micro-pores of
the billet matrix. Graphitization heat treatment is performed by ATK in between each74
HIPIC procedure at temperatures in excess of 2000 °C [25]. The final density of a billet
after the 5-cycle densification process is on average 1.95 g/cm3 [25].

The original module design as flown on the Galileo, Ulyses and Cassini
missions had a mass of 1.433 kg [4] and a geometry of 53.09 mm x 97.18 mm x 93.17
mm [4]. This module design is often referred to as the “Heritage module”. Modification
to the GPHS module design came prior to the assembly of the GPHS-RTG built for
NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt that was launched in 2006.
The modification was made due to concerns regarding the integrity of the module under
accident scenarios that could have occurred during high velocity gravity-assist fly-bys
of the Earth. This modification resulted in the production of the “Step-1 Enhanced
module” with an external geometry of 53.09 mm x 99.6 mm x 93.17 mm and a mass of
1.514 kg [27]. The subtle difference between the Heritage and the Step-1 Enhanced
module was in the separation of the GIS assemblies (from 0.53 mm to 2.53 mm) and
the filling of the aeroshell void that existed in regions of the heritage module design
(between the two GIS assemblies), hence the mass increment.
The most recent modification to the GPHS module design came prior to the
assembly of the Multi-Mission RTG built for NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory rover75
mission. Five millimetres of FWPF material were added to the height of the GPHS
aeroshell following concern over the integrity of the module in modern launcher
accidents. This latest modification is known as the Step-2 Enhanced module and has a
mass of 1.606 kg and an external geometry of 58.2 x 99.6 x 93.2 mm [27]. The Step-2
module design will also be used by the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator
(ASRG). At the time of writing, the Step-2 Enhanced module design is undergoing
ablated-impact testing to ensure improved safety of the module.
3.2 Light Weight Radioisotope Heater Unit (LWRHU)
The Light Weight Radioisotope Heater Unit (LWRHU) produces a thermal
output power of 1 W. The complete LWRHU has an average total mass of 39.9 grams,
a length of 31.9 mm and a diameter of 25.9 mm [2]. The same 238PuO2 compound that
is used to fuel the GPHS is used to fuel the LWRHU. In the case of the LWRHU, the
PuO2 is encapsulated in a platinum-rhodium alloy. The alloy is 70% Pt and 30% Rh by
at. %.. Qualification tests on LWRHUs were similar to those for the GPHS modules and
included: hard surface impacts (up to 50 ms-1) [28], thermal shock tests associated with
atmospheric re-entry, explosive shock tube testing [28, 29]. Pressure and containment
tests were also performed for the system immersed in sea water for 1.75 years at both
sea level and at a depth of 6000 m [28]. The complete LWRHU has an average total
mass of 39.9 grams, a length of 31.9 mm and a diameter of 25.9 mm [2].76

3.3 Angel RHU/RTG heat source
The Russian ANGEL RHU/RTG heat source is very similar in design to the LWRHU
developed in the United States. Its thermal loading is approximately 8.5 Wth and is
fuelled by two 238PuO2 pellets. Little qualification data or test information is available
for the ANGEL systems, but it is assumed that function of the insulation and aeroshell
structures is identical to that of the US LWRHU.

3.4 Helium production and its effect upon the encapsulation of
radioisotopes
Radioisotopes, such as 238Pu and 241Am, with an alpha decay mode, will produce
an accumulation of helium and without adequate ventilation the helium accumulation
will result in a pressure increase. Over a short period of time the effect is negligible, but
in the case of alpha emitting isotopes that are useful for RTGs, where activity is high
and time periods can span decades, the helium buildup can be significant. The entire
decay chain should also be considered since non-alpha emitting heat sources may give
rise to alpha-emitting daughter products in addition to gaseous daughter products.
The activity of the radioisotope will determine the rate of helium production.
The activity of a radioisotope is related to the decay constant ?.

Equation 3.1 is the relationship between N, the number of isotope nuclei present at time
t from the measurement of nuclei present initially (N0). This may also be used to
determine the number of decays that have taken place after time t. It is often useful to
relate the initial number of nuclei present in a source in terms if its initial activity at the
time of manufacture, A0 (decays/s). This may be determined by the use of Equation 3.2.78
The pressure can be determined by using the ideal gas equation. The ideal gas
equation is given by:
!
PV = nRT (3.3)
P, is the pressure of a gas in a given volume, V, R is the universal gas constant, T, the
temperature of the system and n, the number of moles of gas present.
Using these two equations, it is therefore possible to determine the pressure of
the gas in an unvented structure at any given time, t.

The volume Vvoid used in equations 3.1 to 3.7 above refers to the total void

may only be valid for a complete heat source where it is assumed that the helium
evolved during the alpha decay process is given free mobility throughout the matrix.
Since Vvoid is a function of the matrix (bulk) density, it is possible to determine Vvoid of

To illustrate the significance of the helium retention problem over the a 30 year
time period, a typical lifetime of a modern heat source, the specifications of a GPHS
fuel pellet are considered with the exclusion of helium ventilation. In a GPHS fuel
pellet there are 188 g of 238PuO2 pressed to approximately 80 % (e=0.8) of its
theoretical density (?Th=11.46 g/cm3). Its initial activity may be assumed to be 2.84 kCi
based on a specific activity for 238PuO2 of 15.1 Ci/g [8]. 238Pu has a half-life of 87.74
years [8] and therefore has a decay constant (?) of 2.505x10-10 s-1. In a total pellet
volume of approximately 20.5 cm3, we assume a Vvoid of 4.101 cm3 at operational
temperatures of 600 °C (873 °K) in which helium can accumulate. This assumption is
supported by the measurement of helium released from GPHS fuel pellets PuO2 at
operational temperatures [12]. Using Equation 3.5 the total pressure in a sealed GPHS
fuel pellet after 30 years would be 2.60 MPa.80
To understand the physical impact the pressure increase has on the cladding, the
hoop stress (circumferential stress) on a thin walled pressure vessel should be
considered. For a given diameter to wall thickness ratio that is greater than a factor of
10, the hoop stress of a thin wall cylinder may be determined by Equation 3.9 below.
!
"# =
Pr
w
(3.9)
s? = hoop stress (Pa)
P = Inner Pressure (Pa)
r = Inner Radius (m)
w = Wall Thickness (m)
Typically, a pressure vessel will fail when the hoop stress is greater than or
equal to the ultimate tensile stress. For an Iridium DOP-26 cladding, the ultimate tensile
strength sU is 590 MPa at 600 °C [31]. The result from applying equation 3.15
substituted into equation 3.19 can be used to estimate the hoop stress in addition to the
physical specifications for the cladding. For the purpose of this example we use the clad
thickness w of 0.73 mm [4] and an inner radius r of 1.421 cm to estimate that when the
internal pressure is 2.60 MPa, the hoop stress is 50.59 MPa indicating a significant
safety margin of more than a factor of 10 when compared to the tensile strength of the
Ir cladding. From this result it is clear that in the case of a clad GPHS fuel module, the
source will remain sealed over a period of 30 years, which spans production, storage
and operation in flight. Welded joints, present in the design of the GPHS fuel cladding
[11], can introduce weaknesses that may not conform to the safety margin requirements
on the cladding material. The failure pressure may be much lower than that associated
with the limits in tensile strength of the encapsulating walls [11]. This is a primary
reason for venting heat sources that operate at high temperatures for space applications.
A secondary reason for the provision of ventilation paths in a cladding material is the81
risk associated with rupturing on impact, in a mission failure scenario, resulting in the
release and potentially the dispersal of radioactive materials in the environment. [28].
