The goal of this paper is to give an introduction to the representation
theory of Lie algebras. In the rst part, the fundamentals
of Lie groups and their Lie algebras are presented in a very compact
form. In the second and the third part, the representations
of su(2) and su(3) are discussed and basic terms are introduced.
In the forth part follows the generalization of the machinery introduced
in the analysis of su(2) and su(3). The last part is
related to the classication of complex simple Lie algebras. Most
of the proofs are omitted in the rst, the forth and the fth part.
1 Introduction
Lie algebras are closely connected to symmetries. Their use in the description
of physical systems allows to apply algebraical methods to get further insight.
Concrete applications of Lie theory appear in the description of atomic, molecular
and nuclear spectra or in gauge theories. Furthermore, Lie algebras are related to
several algebraical structures like group algebras, Hopf algebras, quantum groups
and vertex operator algebras which are used in mathematical physics. The goal
of this paper is to provide an informal introduction to Lie theory. A detailed
presentation of the subject is given in [1, 2].

2 Fundamentals
Denition of a Lie Group
Denition (Lie Group). A Lie group G is a set G that has two structures
that are compatible to each other the structure of a group and the structure
of a C1-manifold. 'Compatible' means that the operations 'multiplication' and
'inverse' associated to the group structure of G are dierentiable maps (C1).
12 Topology in Physics
Denition 1. Let G and H be two Lie groups. A homomorphism between Lie
groups is a group homomorphism which is dierentiable. In the remainder of this
section we will simply write 'homomorphism' instead of 'homomorphism between
Lie groups'.
Denition 2. Let G be a Lie group. A representation of G is a homomorphism
between Lie groups from G to GL(V ).
The matrix group GLn(R) is a basic example for a Lie group. This group
is an open subset of the vector space of all n  n matrices and therefore a C1-
manifold. Obviously, the multiplication is dierentiable as well as the inverseoperation
(compare Cramer's rule).
Whenever no basis is specied, the maps corresponding to the matrices in GLn(R)
must be considered as automorphisms. The set of all automorphisms V ! V is
denoted by GL(V ).
Denition 3. A complex Lie group is a complex manifold endowed with a group
structure in such a way that the operations 'product' and 'inverse' associated to
the group structure are holomorphic maps.
A complex manifold is a smooth manifold of dimension 2n such that the local
charts (U; ) have the property that the change-of-coordinate map    are
holomorphic.
Denition and basic properties of Lie Algebras
The ultimate goal is the study of representations of Lie groups. For that purpose
one makes use of the dierentiable structure of the Lie group. More precisely,
we will try to determine a characterization of   G ! H being a Lie group
homomorphism expressed by maps between tangent spaces of G and H.
The right idea is to look at the automorphisms of G given by conjugation
	g  G ! G
h ! 	g(h) = g  h  g??1,
i.e.,
	  G ! GL(G); (1.1)
where GL(G) denotes the set of all automorphisms on G. We observe
 group homomorphism )   g = (g)  ; (1.2)
since
  g(h) = (g)(h)??1(g) = (g)  (h)
We are going to dierentiate (at the identity) two times, i.e., we use that  is
dierentiable. After the second dierentiation we will deduce an identity based onLie Algebras a crash course 3
the assumption that  is a group homomorphism that involves only the dierential
of .
Dierentiation at the identity of (1.2) yields
de  d( g)e = d( (g))e  de
We dene a new map to reformulate this result.
Denition 4. The adjoint map Ad is dened as
Ad  G ! GL(TeG)
g 7! Ad(g) = d(	g)e  TeG ! TeG
Thus, the adjoint map Ad realizes a representation of G called the adjoint representation
of the Lie group G.
Therefore,
 group homomorphism ) de  Ad(g) = Ad((g))  de (1.3)
This identity still explicitly depends on (g). Thus, we dierentiate a second
time to get
de  d(Ad)e(X)(Y ) = d(Ad)e(de(X); de(Y )) (1.4)
Denition 5. One denes ad = d(Ad)e. The tangent space at GL(TeG) can be
identied with the entire space End(TeG). Thus,
ad  TeG ! End(TeG)
X 7! ad(X) = d(Ad)e(X)  TeG ! TeG
Therefore, we can consider the map ad to be a bilinear map
TeG  TeG ! TeG
Notation
[X; Y ] = ad(X)(Y )
Using this denition in identity (1.4) yields the following important identity
(Assumption  is a homomorphism)
de([X; Y ]) = [de(X); de(Y )] (1.5)
We can even state the following two assertions which are much stronger (without
proof)
Theorem 1. Let G and H be two Lie groups, with G connected. Then Each
homomorphism   G ! H is uniquely determined by its dierential de 
TeG ! TeH at the identity.4 Topology in Physics
Theorem 2. Let G and H be two Lie groups, with G connected and simply
connected. Then A linear map L  TeG ! TeH is the dierential of a
homomorphism   G ! H i it preserves the bracket operation, i.e.,
L([X; Y ]) = [L(X);L(Y )]
Observation 1. Properties of the bracket operation [; ] on TeG
1. Skew-symmetry, i.e.,
[X; Y ] = ??[Y;X]
2. Satisfaction of the Jacobi identity, i.e.,
[X; [Y;Z]] + [Z; [X; Y ]] + [Y; [Z;X]] = 0
A general vector space with such a structure is called a Lie algebra
Denition (Lie Algebra). A vector space V together with a skew-symmetric
bilinear form
[; ]  V  V ! V
which satises the Jacobi identity is called a Lie algebra (usually denoted g).
One can also show that the 'contrary' is true as well, i.e., that the tangent
space at a Lie group has exactly the structure of a Lie algebra. That's the reason
why the tangent space TeG of a Lie group G is called the Lie algebra g of the Lie
group G.
An even stronger assertion is (without proof)...
Proposition 1. Every nite-dimensional (abstract) Lie algebra is the Lie algebra
of a Lie group.
A real (complex) Lie algebra is a Lie algebra whose vector space is a real
(complex) vector space.
Denition 6. A homomorphism L  g1 ! g2 between Lie Algebras g1 and g2
is a linear map of vector spaces which preserves the bracket operation, i.e.,
L([X; Y ]g1) = [L(X);L(Y )]g2 
Denition 7. A Lie subalgebra is a linear subspace which is closed under the
bracket.
Let us try to explicitly compute the bracket operation for G = GLnR.Lie Algebras a crash course 5
The Lie group GLn(R) is an open subset of the space End(Rn). Thus, we can
identify End(Rn) with the tangent space TeGLn(R) and the conjugation 	g on
GLn(R) extends naturally to End(Rn) = TeGLn(R), i.e.,
Ad(g)(X)  d(	g)e(X) = g  X  g??1;
for all X 2 TeGLn(R) = End(Rn).
Let X and Y be two tangent vectors to GLn(R) and let   I  R ! GLn(R)
be a curve such that (0) = e and such that 0(0) = X. Then
[X; Y ]  ad(X)(Y )

Denition (Representation). A representation of a Lie algebra g on a vector
space V is a homomorphism between Lie algebras
  g ! gl(V ) = End(V );
i.e.,  is a linear map form the vector space corresponding to g to the vector
space corresponding to gl(V )such that
([X; Y ]g) = [(X); (Y )]gl(V ) = (X)  (Y ) ?? (Y )  (X);
for all X; Y 2 g.
The last equation follows from our discussion about GLn(R) with the only
dierence that this time gl(V ) is considered to be the space of automorphisms
and not to be a space of matrices (i.e., no basis has been specied).
As corollaries of theorem 1 and theorem 2 we can state the following crucial
observation.
Crucial Observation. The representations of a connected and simply connected
Lie group are in one-to-one correspondence to the representations of its Lie algebra.
Denition 8. Let V be a nite-dimensional real vector space. Then the complexi
cation VC of the vector space V is the space of formal combinations
v1 + iv2;
with v1, v2 2 V . This is a real vector space and becomes a complex vector space,
if we dene
i(v1 + iv2)  iv1 ?? v26 Topology in Physics
Proposition 2. Let g be a nite-dimensional real Lie algebra and gC its complexi
cation to a complex vector space. Then there exists a unique extension of
the bracket operation of the Lie algebra g to the vector space gC which becomes a
Lie algebra.
Proof. Since the extension of the bracket must still be bilinear, we have that
[X1 + iX2; Y1 + iY2] = ([X1; Y1] ?? [X2; Y2]) + i([X1; Y2] + [X2; Y1])
Therefore the extension is unique. To proof the existence of the extension of
the Lie bracket we must check that the new bracket fullls the demands in the
denition of a Lie bracket. The extension is obviously skew symmetric and real
bilinear since this is true for the bracket on g.
To check complex bilinearity we only have to check (think of skew-symmetry)
that the new bracket is complex-linear in one argument
[i(X1 + iX2); Y1 + iY2] = [iX1 ?? X2; Y1 + iY2]
= (??[X1; Y2] ?? [X2; Y1]) + i([X1; Y1] ?? [X2; Y2])
= i(([X1; Y1] ?? [X2; Y2]) + i([X1; Y2] + [X2; Y1]))
= i[X1 + iX2; Y1 + iY2]
What is left to check is the Jacobi identity. We rst observe (using bilinearity)
that
[X; [Y;Z]] + [Z; [X; Y ]] + [Y; [Z;X]] = 0;
for all X 2 gC and Y;Z 2 g. The same argument applies to Y;Z and it follows
that the Jacobi identity holds for the extended bracket on gC.
Denition 9. The vector space gC together with the unique extension of the
bracket operation of a real Lie algebra g is called the complexication gC of the
real Lie algebra g.
Proposition 3. Let g be a real Lie algebra and gC its complexication. Then
an arbitrary nite-dimensional complex representation ~ of g can be extended
uniquely to a complex-linear representation of gC given by
(X + iY ) = ~(X) + i~(Y )
for all X; Y 2 g.
In addition we have that  is irreducible i ~ is irreducible.
Proof. Existence and uniqueness are trivial.
Let us prove the statement concerning the irreducibility.
) Let ~ be irreducible and let W be a complex linear subspace invariant
under . This implies that W is invariant under ~. Therefore W is equal to f0g
or to the whole representation space )  is irreducible.Lie Algebras a crash course 7
( Let  be irreducible and let W be a complex linear subspace invariant
under ~. We deduce that (W)  ~(W) + i~(W)  W since W is a complex
vector space. Therefore W is equal to f0g or is equal to the entire representation
space ) ~ is irreducible.
Lemma 1. su(n)C
=
sl(n;C)
Proof. The complexication su(n)C of the real Lie algebra su(n) and sl(n;C)
are subalgebras of the Lie algebra gl(n;C) (compare the denition of the complexi
cation). The Lie algebra sl(n;C) is the space of complex and traceless
n  n-matrices. We can write each element X of sl(n;C) (uniquely) in the form
X =
X ?? X
2
+ i
X + X
2i
;
where (X??X)=2 and (X+X)=2i are both traceless and skew and are therefore
elements of su(n). This implies the claim.
The Exponential Map
Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g, X 2 g and g 2 G. The map mg  G !
G is the dieomorphism dened by left-multiplication with g, i.e., mg(h) = g  h
for all h 2 G.
Now we introduce a vector eld on the Lie group G dened by
vX(g) = (mg)(X) (1.7)
((mg)(X)  d(mg)mg??1X.) This is locally integrable. Thus, there exists I  R,
  I ! G dierentiable with (0) = e, such that
0
X(t) = vX(X(t)) (1.8)
for all t 2 I. Since (s+t) = (s)  (t) and since  is dened on a nite interval
I, we can deduce that  extends uniquely to all of R
X  R ! G (1.9)
Denition 10. Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g. We dene the exponential
map by
exp  g ! G
X 7! exp(X) = X(1)
Properties of the exponential map8 Topology in Physics
1. Let be a Lie group homomorphism. Then the following diagram commutes
g
 ??????! h yexp
 yexp
G

2. The exponential map is dierentiable. Its derivative at the origin of g is the
identity map. Thus, the exponential map realizes a dieomorphism from a
neighborhood of the origin of TeG = g to a neighborhood of the identity
element e 2 G. Such a neighborhood of e 2 G generates the identity
component of G.
3. Let G be a compact Lie group with Lie algebra g. Then exponentiation of
a representation of g yields a representation of G.
4. X(t) = exp(t  X)
5. exp((t + t0)  X) = exp(t  X)  exp(t0  X)
6. exp(??X) = (exp(X))??1
7. Let G be a matrix Lie group. Then the exponential map is equal to the
exponential map of matrices, i.e.,
exp(X) =
X1
k=0
Xk
k!
for all X 2 G.
First Classication of Lie Algebras
As it is usual in mathematics, we have started with the discussion of a certain
mathematical structure (here the Lie algebra). Once one doesn't get any further
in the general analysis, one tries to organize the dierent manifestations of the
general structure, i.e., one tries to classify the original structure. The next step
is the investigation of the dierent classes. The following classication reects
how much a Lie algebra fails to be Abelian.
Denition 11. Let g be a Lie algebra and let h  g be a subalgebra. The
subalgebra is an ideal if
[X; Y ] 2 h
for all X 2 h and Y 2 g.Lie Algebras a crash course 9
The bracket operation on g induces a bracket operation on the quotient space
g=h i h is an ideal of g.
Therefore, we make the next denition.
Denition 12. A Lie algebra is called simple if dim g  1 and if it contains no
nontrivial ideals.
Denition 13. The lower central series Dkg of subalgebras is dened by
D1g = [g; g]; Dkg = [g;Dk??1g]
The subalgebras Dkg are ideals in g.
Denition 14. The derived series Dkg of subalgebras is dened by
D1g = [g; g]; Dkg = [Dk??1g;Dk??1g]
The subalgebras Dkg are ideals in g and Dkg  Dkg for all k.
Furthermore, D1g = D1g = Dg.
Denition 15. Let g be a Lie algebra. Then
1. g is called nilpotent if Dkg = 0 for some k.
2. g is called solvable if Dkg = 0 for some k.
3. g is called perfect if Dg = g.
4. g is called semisimple if g has no nonzero solvable ideals.
The term 'semisimple' will become clearer in the section about semisimple Lie
algebras.
The sum of two solvable ideals of a Lie algebra g is again solvable.
Denition 16. The sum of all solvable ideals of g is a maximal solvable ideal,
called the radical Rad(g) of g.
The following proposition can be used to determine the radical of g (the
denition of the Killing form follows in section 5).
Proposition 4. Let g be a Lie algebra. Then the radical Rad(g) of g is the
orthogonal complement to Dg with respect to the Killing form.
The quotient g=Rad(g) is semisimple according to the denition of semisimplicity.
A consequence of Lie's theorem (compare Fulton and Harris x9.2) is that
any irreducible representation of a solvable Lie algebra is one-dimensional. One
arrives at the following theorem which describes how to nd irreducible representations
of an arbitrary complex Lie algebra g.10 Topology in Physics
Theorem 3. Let g be an arbitrary complex Lie algebra and let gsemisimple =
g=Rad(g) be its semisimple component.
Then Every irreducible representation  of g is of the form
 = semisimple 
 L;
where semisimple is an irreducible representation of gsemisimple (i.e., a representation
of g that is trivial on Rad(g)), and L is a one-dimensional representation.
Simple Lie Algebras
As we will see in section 6, every simple complex Lie algebra is either isomorphic
to sln(C), son(C), sp2n(C) (the symplectic Lie algebra) or to one of the so
called exceptional Lie algebras.
Semisimple Lie Algebras
There are two fundamental problems concerning the representations of general
Lie groups and general Lie algebras rst, the complete reducibility property of
representations is not valid and second, the action of an element in a Lie group
or in a Lie algebra can be diagonalizable under one representation and not under
another. This problems vanish immediately as soon as we pass to semisimple Lie
algebras.
Theorem (Complete Reducibility). Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra and let
 be an arbitrary representation of g with representation space V . Assume that
W  V is an invariant subspace under the action of g.
Then there exists a subspace W0  V complementary to W and invariant under
the action of g.
Recall that we can write any endomorphism X of a complex vector space V
in the form
X = Xs + Xn;
where Xs is diagonalizable and Xn is nilpotent.
Theorem (Preservation of Jordan Decomposition). Let g be a semisimple
Lie algebra. Then there exist for any X 2 g elements Xs 2 g and Xn 2 g such
that
(X)s = (Xs); (X)n = (Xn)
for any representation , where (X)s is diagonalizable and where (X)n is nilpotent.
In addition, the following proposition holdsLie Algebras a crash course 11
Proposition 5. The following is equivalent
1. g is a semisimple Lie algebra.
2. g is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras.
3. The Killing form is non-degenerate (i.e., the set fx 2 V j  x; y Killing=
0 for all y 2 V g is trivial).
4. g has no nonzero Abelian ideals.
5. The radical of g is zero.
3 Representations of su(2)
The goal of this section is to analyze the irreducible complex representations of
su(2). Motivation First, in the analysis of the representations of general semisimple
Lie algebras one uses the representations of sl(2;C) = su(2), second, su(2) is
an easy example of how one uses commutation relations to get the representations
of a Lie algebra and third, su(2) is of physical importance.
In proposition 3 we saw that every nite-dimensional complex representation of
su(2) extends uniquely to a complex-linear representation of the complexication
su(2)C. According to Lemma 1 this complexication is isomorphic to sl(2;C).
Therefore the extension of a representation  to sl(2;C) is irreducible i the representation
 of su(2) is irreducible.
We conclude that the study of the irreducible representations of su(2) is equivalent
to the study of the irreducible complex-linear representations of sl(2;C).
We prefer the analysis of sl(2;C) to the analysis of su(2) since we can work with
the following nice basis in the case of sl(2;C) which will simplify our computations
H =

1 0

1 0

; (1.10)
with
[H;X] = 2X; [H; Y ] = ??2Y; [X; Y ] = H (1.11)
Assume that  is an arbitrary irreducible nite-dimensional representation of
sl(2;C) on a vector space V .
As a rst observation we have the following remark which is a result of the
preservation of the Jordan decomposition under a representation (compare section
2)
Remark 1. (H) is diagonalizable and therefore
V =
M
V;
where the index  runs over the eigenvalues of (H) which are complex numbers.12 Topology in Physics
With the decomposition of V into eigenspaces of (H) we have brought a rst
structure (wrt the action of (H)) into the representation space V . As a result of
the commutation relations (1.11) we will see in the following that this structure of
V will be preserved under the action of (X) and (Y ) () the structure will be
preserved under the action of (sl(2;C))). This will equip us with much insight
into representations of sl(2;C).
After this outlook let us try to answer the following question How do (X)
and (Y ) act on the decomposition in Remark 1
Remark 2. LetW =
L
W be a decomposition of a vectorspaceW into eigenspaces
W of a linear Operator L acting on W with eigenvalues  2 C. Whenever one
wants to determine in which eigenspace the vector K(w) (w 2 W; K being
another linear Operator on W) lies, we simply apply L
L(K(w)) = K(w);  2 C , K(w) 2 W
Therefore the answer to the question above is given by the following calculation
using the commutation relations (1.11)
(H)  (X)(v) = (X)  (H)(v) + [(H); (X)](v)
= (X)  (H)(v) + 2(X)(v)
= ( + 2)  (X)(v); for v 2 V (1.12)
Similarly,
(H)  (Y )(v) = (Y )  (H)(v) + [(H); (Y )](v)
= (Y )  (H)(v) ?? 2(Y )(v)
= ( ?? 2)  (Y )(v); for v 2 V (1.13)
We summarize these results in the following
Lemma 2.
(H)  V ! V (X)  V ! V+2 (Y )  V ! V??2
From the 3 facts that
1.  is irreducible () the only invariant subspaces are V and f0g),
2. only those subspaces V and V are getting mapped into each other by the
action of sl(2;C) i  ??  is an integer multiple of 2 and
3. only nitely many linear subspaces can contribute to a direct-sum-decomposition
of V (since the vector space V is nite-dimensional)Lie Algebras a crash course 13
we deduce that
Lemma 3. There exists  2 C and k 2 Z, such that
V = V  V+2  V+4    V+2k
Dene n =  + 2k 2 C.
Lemma 4. Let v 2 Vn+2k. Then
V = spanfv; (Y )(v); (Y )2(v); (Y )3(v); g
Proof. Dene W  spanfv; (Y )(v); (Y )2(v); (Y )3(v); g. Recall that the
representation  is irreducible by assumption. This implies that it is sucient to
show that W is invariant under the action of X; Y and H. Again we will use the
commutation relations (1.11).
W is preserved under the action of Y since (Y )  (Y )m(v) = (Y )m+1(v) 2 W
for all m 2 N.
W is preserved under the action of H since all the basis elements of W lie in
dierent eigenspaces of (H) which are all preserved under the action of H.
It is left to show that
(X)  (Y )m(v)) 2 W; 8v 2 W
Consider the case m = 0
(X)(v) = 0
(compare Lemma 3).
Consider the case m = 1
(X)  (Y )(v) = (Y )  (X)(v) + [(X); (Y )](v)
= 0 + (H)(v)
= nv
Consider the case m = 2
(X)  (Y )((Y )(v)) = (Y )  (X)((Y )(v)) + [(X); (Y )]((Y )(v))
= (Y )  (nv) + (H)((Y )(v))
= n(Y )(v) + (n ?? 2)(Y )(v)

Repeating these calculations yields

= m(n ?? m + 1)  (Y )(m??1)(v) (1.14)14 Topology in Physics
The last step can easily be proved by induction (m ) m+1, the cases m = 0; 1; 2
have already been checked above)
n + (n ?? 2) + (n ?? 4) +    + (n ?? 2(m + 1 ?? 1)) = n + (n ?? 2) + (n ?? 4) +

= m(n ?? m + 1) + n ?? 2m
= mn ?? m2 + m + n ?? 2m

We have shown that (Y )m(v) is mapped to a multiple (Y )m??1(v) ) W is
preserved under the action of X.
) W = V and fv; (Y )(v); (Y )2(v); (Y )3(v); g forms a basis of V .
Corollary 1. For each eigenspace V of (H) we have that
dim V = 1
Since we know how the basis elements H; X and Y act on the basis vector
of each eigenspace V, we know how the representation  of sl(2;C) acts on the
vector space V as linear maps. Thus, we know how the representation  of
sl(2;C) acts on the whole vector space V =
L
V and we arrive at the second
corollary of lemma 4
Corollary 2. Every irreducible representation  of sl(2;C) is determined by the
set f 2 CjV is an eigenspace of (H)g.
Let m 2 N be the smallest non-negative integer such that (Y )m(v) = 0 with
v 2 Vn. We apply (X) and use identity (1.14) to get
0 = (X)  (Y )m(v) = m(n ?? m + 1)  (Y )(m??1)(v) (1.15)
Since (Y )(m??1)(v) is by assumption not equal to zero we get
0 = (n ?? m + 1) , m = n + 1 (1.16)
But the integer m is also equal to the dimension of V . Thus, we deduce, that
the representation space V is n+1-dimensional (compare lemma 2, lemma 3 and
corollary 1).
This implies that the direct decomposition V =
L
V of V into one-dimensional
eigenspaces V of (H) consists of n + 1 terms. We deduce
V = Vn  Vn??2      Vn??2n
= Vn  Vn??2      V??n+2  V??n (1.17)
We can summarize the former results in the following theorem.Lie Algebras a crash course 15
Theorem 4. Let  be an irreducible representation of sl(2;C) with representation
space V . Then the spectrum of (H) is a subset of Z of the form
f??n; ??n + 2; ??n + 4;    ; ??2; 0; 2;    ; n ?? 2; ng
or
f??n; ??n + 2; ??n + 4;    ; ??1; 1;    ; n ?? 2; ng
Each irreducible representation of sl(2;C) can be labeled by the largest eigenvalue
n of (H). Each eigenspace of (n)(H) is one-dimensional and V (n) L =
k2f??n; ??n+2; ; n??2; ng V (n)
k .
Corollary 3. The number of irreducible factors in an arbitrary representation 
of sl(2;C) is equal to the multiplicities of 0 and 1 as eigenvalues of (H).
4 Representations of su(3)
Denitions and rst Observations
As in the case of su(2) we observe that we are allowed to study the representations
of sl(3;C) instead of su(3), since the representations of sl(3;C) are in one-to-one
correspondence with the complex-linear representations of the complexication
suC(3) = sl(3;C) (compare proposition 3 and lemma 1).
The main result of our discussion about the irreducible representation of su(2)
was that each irreducible representation  can be classied in term of the largest
eigenvalue of (H).
Thus, it arises the natural question, which element in (sl(3;C)) will take over
the role of (H). The answer is that there isn't any such element in (sl(3;C)).
But instead we will use a whole subspace h of (sl(3;C)).
The main goal of this section is to classify the irreducible representations of
sl(3;C) (as we have done it in the analysis of (sl(2;C))). We will prove that
these representations are determined (up to equivalence) by their highest weight
(to be dened later).
The study of sl(3;C) will equip us with the concepts necessary to classify the
nite-dimensional representations of all semisimple Lie algebras.
We dene h  sl(3;C) to be the two-dimensional subspace of all diagonal
matrices in sl(3;C) (this is the so called Cartan subalgebra for sl(3;C)).

Denition 17. Let  be an arbitrary representation of sl(3;C) with representation
space V . Then we dene
1. A vector v 2 V is a weight vector if v is a simultaneous eigenvector for
(H) for each H 2 h.
2. Let v be a weight vector with corresponding eigenvalue (H) for H 2 h.
This quantity (H) is a complex number depending linearly on H 2 h, i.e.,
 2 h. The linear functional  is called a weight of the representation.
3. All the weight vectors corresponding to a weight  span a vector space V
which is a so called weight space.
4. The dimension of the weight space V is called the multiplicity of the weight
.
According to the preservation of the Jordan decomposition (compare section
2) all elements in h are diagonalizable in any representation of sl(3;C).
Additionally, all elements in h commute in any representation of sl(3;C) since
they commute in sl(3;C). Recall that commuting, diagonalizable matrices are
simultaneously diagonalizable.
Remark 3. This implies that any nite-dimensional representation space V decomposes
into a direct sum of weight spaces (i.e., simultaneous eigenspaces) V
of all elements in h
V =
M
V;
where  2 h ranges over a nite subset of h since V is nite-dimensional by
assumption.
Now that we know how to 'replace' the basis element H from the discussion
of sl(2;C) we should determine how to 'replace' the basis elements X and Y .
Recall that
ad(H)(X) = [H;X] = 2X; ad(H)(Y ) = [H; Y ] = ??2Y; (1.21)
i.e., the elements X and Y 2 sl(2;C) are eigenvectors for the adjoint action
of H 2 sl(2;C). Thus, to replace X and Y 2 sl(2;C) we have to look for
simultaneous eigenvectors for the adjoint action of h (i.e., weight vectors in the
case of the adjoint representation). This yields a decomposition
sl(3;C) = h  (
M
g); (1.22)Lie Algebras a crash course 17
where  ranges over a nite subset of h as explained in remark 3. The subspaces
g  sl(3;C) are the analogue of the subspaces V appearing in remark 3, i.e.,
ad(H)(X) = [H;X] = (H)  X; (1.23)
for every H 2 h and X 2 g.
Denition 18. In case of the adjoint representation weights are called roots,
weight vectors are called root vectors and weight spaces are called root spaces.
The nite set of all roots is denoted R  h.
The next goal is to determine the subspaces g  sl(3;C) and to explicitly
write down the corresponding weight  2 h.
To determine the g's observe that
[H;M]ij = [

A]ij = (ai ?? aj)  mij (1.24)
for every H 2 h and M 2 sl(3;C). Thus, M 2 sl(3;C) is a root vector i all
but one entry of M are zero. We deduce that the root spaces g are spanned by
matrices Ei;j which are dened to be the (3  3)-matrices whose (i; j)th entry is
equal to 1 and whose other entries are equal to zero. In total we span six (Ei;j 2
sl(3;C)) one-dimensional complex subspaces of sl(3;C) (recall that sl(3;C) is
8-dimensional, that h is 2-dimensional and remember identity (1.22)).
Example 1. We apply the above thoughts to E1;2, which spans a certain root
space of sl(3;C)
ad(H)(E1;2) = (H)  E1;2 = (a1 ?? a2)  E1;2 ) (H) = L1 ?? L2
(Compare equation (1.20) for the last implication.)
Therefore we arrive at the
Observation 2. The root of the root space spanned by the matrix Ei;j is Li??Lj .
We have seen that the representation space V decomposes into a direct sum of
weight spaces and that sl(3;C) = h(
L
g). The subspace h  sl(3;C) acts on
the dierent V's as scalar multiplication (by denition of the V's). To get more
information about how the g's act on the V's, we proceed exactly as in (1.12)
We use commutation relations. First, we have to consider the special case of the
adjoint representation (recall the Jacobi identity)
ad(H)  ad(X)(Y )  [H; [X; Y ]]
= ??[Y; [H;X]] ?? [X; [Y;H]]
= [[H;X]; Y ] + [X; [H; Y ]]
= ((H) + (H))  ad(X)(Y ); (1.25)
for every H 2 h, X 2 g and Y 2 g. This crucial calculation proves the following
fundamental observation.18 Topology in Physics
Observation 3.
ad(g)  g ! g+
Let us proceed to the general case (recall that the commutation relations are
the same in every representation)
(H)  (X)(v) = [(H); (X)](v) + (X)  (H)(v)
= (H)  (X)(v) + (H)  (X)(v)
= ((H) + (H))  (X)(v); (1.26)
for all H 2 h, X 2 g and v 2 V. We deduce
Observation 4.
(g)  V ! V+
As a consequence, the weights of an arbitrary irreducible representation dier
only by integral linear combinations of Li ?? Lj , i.e., linear combinations with
integer coecients (recall that there must not exists any other invariant subspace
than V or f0g).
Denition 19. The integral linear combinations of Li??Lj generate a lattice R
called the root lattice.
Consider again the adjoint representation. From the structure of the roots
(i.e., the weights for the adjoint representation) one can deduce much knowledge
about the Lie algebra. Thus, we introduce the following diagrammatical method
Draw the six roots Li ?? Lj 2 h lying in the real subspace ~h with two real
dimensions as in gure 1.1.
The points symbolize the root space corresponding to each specic root. The
'0' in the middle should be considered as the Cartan subalgebra h (which corresponds
to the root '0' since its elements commute). The irreducibility of the
adjoint representation implies that the subspace h and all the g's get mapped
into each other under the action of sl(3;C) = h(
L
g) (recall that there must
not be any invariant subspace dierent from f0g and the representation space
V = sl(3;C)). We deduce that the only possibility to draw the six roots Li ?? Lj
is the one shown in gure 1.1 (compare also observation 3). The locations of L1,
L2 and L3 follow.
In the discussion of sl(2;C) we discovered an 'extremal' eigenspace Vn for the
action of H (by 'extremal' we mean that Vn is sent to f0g under the action of X,
i.e. Vn is sent to f0g by half of the roots).
To deduce an analog statement for the present discussion, we have to explain
what we mean by 'extremal' in the context of sl(3;C).
Seen from another point of view, the extremal eigenspace Vn of sl(2;C) is the
eigenspace corresponding to the root n lying farthest away from the origin ofLie Algebras a crash course 19
Figure 1.1 Root diagram for sl(3;C)
the one-dimensional vector space h
sl(2;C). In the present circumstances we are
dealing with a 2-dimensional Cartan subalgebra h. Thus, we rst have to dene
a specic direction (we will see that the specic choice doesn't aect the result).
More concretely, we dene a linear functional
l  R ! C; (1.27)
such that l never vanishes on R, i.e., the kernel of l doesn't intersect any lattice
point of R so that
R = R+ [ R?? (1.28)
(disjoint) with l()  0 for all  2 R+ and l()  0 for all  2 R??. A speci
c example of the present circumstances is shown in gure 1.2 (the thick line
visualizes the kernel of l).
We call a root space g extremal, if  is the farthest root in the chosen specic
direction.
Observation 5. The extremal root space gL1??L3 (in case of the specic example
shown in the gure above) is sent to f0g under the action of R+ = fL2??L3; L1??
L3; L1 ?? L2; g. I.e., the elements in gL1??L3 are simultaneous eigenvectors for all
elements in h and get killed by the action of half of the roots. Thus, we have
arrived at a situation which is completely analogue to the one discussed in the
case of sl(2;C).
The explicit expression of l from our specic example is of the form
l(1L1 + 2L2 + 3L3) = 1a + 2b + 3c (1.29)20 Topology in Physics

Note that the positive root spaces are generated by the matrices Ei;j for i  j
and that the negative root spaces are generated by the matrices Ei;j for i  j.
Let us pass over to the analysis of an arbitrary nite-dimensional representation
 of sl(3;C) with representation space V . We summarize the observations
above in the following lemma wrt the general irreducible representation.
Lemma 5. One can always nd a vector v 2 V , such that
1. v is a simultaneous eigenvector for all elements in h and such that
2. v gets killed by the application (E2;3), (E1;3) or (E1;2) (i.e, by the action
of all elements corresponding to the roots in R+).
The vector v 2 V in the lemma is called a highest weight vector.
In the analysis of sl(2;C) we proceeded at this point by claiming that the vectors
v; Y (v); Y 2(v); Y 3(v);    (with v being a highest weight vector) would generate
the whole representation.
Claim 1. Let  be an irreducible representation of sl(3;C) with representation
space V and highest weight vector v. Then the representation is generated by the
successive application of (E2;1), (E3;1) and (E3;2) (which correspond to the
roots in R??) on v.
Proof. Let W be the subspace generated by the images of the highest weight
vector v under the application of (E2;1), (E3;1) and (E3;2). We are going to
show that W is invariant under the action of sl(3;C). Then irreducibility of Lie Algebras a crash course 21
will imply that V = W.
The short calculation [E2;1;E3;2] = ??E3;1 veries thatW is spanned by the images
of successive applications of (E2;1) and (E3;2). Recall that
sl(3;C) = h  C  E1;2  C  E1;3  C  E2;3  C  E2;1  C  E3;1  C  E3;2
The vector space W is obviously invariant under (h) (the operators (E2;1),
(E3;2) transform weight spaces into weight spaces; compare observation 4) and
C  (E2;1), C  (E3;1), C  (E3;2)(true according to the denition of W).
It is left to check the invariance under the application of C  (E1;2), C  (E1;3)
and C  (E2;3)
Since [E1;2;E2;3] = E1;3 it is enough to show that W is invariant under the
successive application of (E1;2) and (E2;3). We prove this by induction over
the number of factors (E1;2) and (E2;3) applied to the highest weight vector v.
We start with only one factor First, we show that the vector (E2;1)(v) stays
in W after the application of (E1;2) and (E2;3). We begin with the action of
(E1;2)
(E1;2)  (E2;1)(v) = [(E1;2); (E2;1)](v) + (E2;1)  (E1;2)(v)
= [(E1;2); (E2;1)](v) + 0
= ([(E1;2); (E2;1)])  v 2 W
We have used that E1;2(v) = 0 (by denition of v) and that [(E1;2); (E2;1)] 2 h.
On the other hand the action of (E2;3)
(E2;3)  (E2;1)(v) = [(E2;3); (E2;1)](v) + (E2;1)  (E2;3)(v)
= 0
We have used that E2;3(v) = 0 (by denition of v) and that [(E2;3); (E2;1)] = 0.
An analogue statement proves that (E3;2)(v) is invariant under the action of
(E1;2) and (E2;3).
For the remainder of this proof we dene wn(v) to be the image of v under an
action which consists of a sequence of factors (E2;1) and (E3;2) with length n
or less. Additionally, we dene Wn to be the vector space spanned by all possible
vectors wn. Thus, W =
S
Wn
Claim (E1;2) and (E2;3) map Wn into Wn??1.
Proof of the claim Each wn is equal to (E2;1)(wn??1) or (E3;2)(wn??1).
'Induction-step' Assume that (E1;2) and (E2;3) map Wn??1 into Wn??2. Note
that wn??1 is a weight vector with some weight .
Case 1  wn = (E2;1)(wn??1)
(E1;2)(wn(v)) = (E1;2)  (E2;1)(wn??1(v))
= [(E1;2); (E2;1)](wn??1(v)) + (E2;1)  (E1;2)(wn??1(v))
= ([(E1;2); (E2;1)])  wn??1(v) + (E2;1)(wn??2(v))

since [(E1;2); (E2;1)] 2 h. On the other hand we have that
(E2;3)(wn(v)) = (E2;3)  (E2;1)(wn??1(v))
= [(E2;3); (E2;1)](wn??1(v)) + (E2;1)  (E2;3)(wn??1(v))
= 0 + (E2;1)(wn??2(v))
=  Wn??1;
since [E2;3;E2;1] = 0.
Case 2  wn = (E3;2)(wn??1) Analogue calculation.
This nishes the proof of the claim.
Since the case 'n = 1' has been veried above the proof of the original claim is
concluded.
Corollary 4. 1. All the weights of an irreducible representation lie in 120-
sector  h with vertex  (the highest weight). Compare the gure below.
2. dim W = 1. Thus all the other weight spaces (generated as in claim 1)
are at most one-dimensional.
Proposition 6. Let  be an arbitrary representation of sl(3;C) with representation
space V and highest weight vector v. Let W denote the vector space spanned
by the images of v under the successive applications of the operators (E2;1),
(E3;1) and (E3;2) (which correspond to the roots in R??). Then W is the
representation space of an irreducible subrepresentation ~.
Proof. Let  denote the so called 'highest weight' corresponding to the highest
weight vector v. The proof of Claim 1 shows that W is the representation spaceLie Algebras a crash course 23
of a subrepresentation ~ (i.e., W is closed under the action of sl(3;C)). We have
to show that this subrepresentation is irreducible.
Let us assume the contrary, i.e., let us assume that ~ is not irreducible. Therefore,
~ = ~0  ~00 for some representations ~0 and ~00 with representation spaces W0
and W00 (W = W0 W00). The operations 'projection to W0 or W00' and 'action
of h' have simultaneous eigenspaces, since they commute. The eigenspaces of the
projections are W0 and W00. Therefore, we arrive at the following decomposition
of W
W = W0 W00
= W W1 W2     (decomposition into weight spaces)
= W0
 W00
 W0
1
W00
1
   
Claim 1 implies that W is one-dimensional. Thus, all the eigenspaces Wi are
at most one-dimensional. We deduce that at least one of the spaces W0i or W00
i
is equal to f0g for each weight space 'i'. Let us assume without loss of generality
that W00
 = f0g. Therefore, (successive applications of sl(3;C))(W = W0)
must reach the whole space W (compare the denition of W). Since the representations
~0 and ~00 are not allowed to mix under the successive action of sl(3;C),
this action applied to W0 can't reach any subspace of W00.
I.e., W is spanned without any elements in W00  W ) W00 = f0g and W0 = W.
) The representation ~ is irreducible.
The Appearance of the Weight Diagram
The next natural question we try to answer is How does a concrete weight
diagram of sl(3;C) look like
We will proceed as follows First, we try to determine the explicit form of the
convex hull of the weights and second, we try to determine the interior of this
convex hull.
The convex Hull
Let us have a second look at gure 1.3 to recall that there aren't any weights
above the line 'generated' by the dots representing the weight spaces g, g+L2??L1 ,
g+2(L2??L1),    and that there aren't any weights to the right of the line 'generated'
by the dots representing the weight spaces g; g+L3??L2 ; g+2(L3??L2);    .
We rst consider the line which is the upper boundary for the nite set of weights.
Finite dimensionality of V implies that there exists an integer m, such that
g+k(L2??L1) = f0g for all k  m (compare gure 1.4). To determine m we make the
following important observation The elements E1;2, E2;1 and H1;2  [E1;2;E2;1]
span a subalgebra (denoted sL1??L2) of sl(3;C) which is isomorphic to sl(2;C).24 Topology in Physics
Figure 1.4 Upper boundary
Observation 6. Let i 6= j. Then the elements Ei;j , Ej;i and Hi;j = [Ei;j ;Ej;i]
span a subalgebra (denoted sLi??Lj ) of sl(3;C) which is isomorphic to sl(2;C).
The subalgebra sL1??L2 shifts the weight spaces V parallel and antiparallel to
the direction L1 ?? L2. Obviously, the subspace
W =
M
k
V+k(L2??L1)
is preserved under the action of sL1??L2 . Thus, W is a representation space of a representation
 of sL1??L2
=
sl(2;C). This representation is irreducible, since there
are no invariant subspaces. We deduce that the eigenvalues of (H12) are integervalued
and the spectrum of (H12) is symmetric about the origin of Z (compare
theorem 4). This implies that the dots representing the spaces V+k(L2??L1) are
symmetric to the line fL 2 hj  L;H1;2 = 0g, where ';' denotes the pairing
between space and dual space. I.e., the dots representing the weight spaces
V+k(L2??L1) are preserved under reection in the line fL 2 hj  L;H1;2 = 0g.
See section 5 for the explicit proof.
Exactly the same consideration applies to the analysis of sL2??L3 . The result is
shown in gure 1.5.
The weight  is the highest weight wrt the linear functional l given in equation
(1.29). But this specic denition was arbitrary. We could have also dened
l, such that b  a  c. As a consequence, the weight  (compare gure 1.5)
would have been the highest weight instead of . Under this circumstances, the
same considerations would have been applicable. Thus, we can update the line
which will enclose all the weights compare gure 1.6.
Now, we continue to apply these considerations for other denitions of the linear
functional l (totally 6 possibilities), until the line forms a closed boundary.Lie Algebras a crash course 25

Observation 7. Let  be a representation of sl(3;C) with representation space
V and highest weight . Then the vertices of the convex hull of the weights
are exactly the images of  under the reections in the three lines fL 2 hj 
Hi;j ;L = 0g (compare gure 1.7). Thus, the convex hull forms a hexagon
(if  =2 one of the three reection-lines) or a triangle (if  2 one of the three
reection-lines).
Claim 2. Every weight  is a linear combination of L2 and L3 (or equivalently
of L1 and L3 or L1 and L2) with integer coecients.
Proof. Observe that from theorem 4 we deduce that all the eigenvalues of (Hi;j)
must be integer-valued, and that h = C  H1;2  C  H1;3. Consider the arbitrary
weight  = 1L1 + 2L2 + 3L3 2 h together with a vector v 2 V.
(H1;2)(v) = (H1;2)  v
= [1L1(H1;2) + 2L2(H1;2) + 3L3(H1;2)]  v (i 2 C)
= (1 ?? 2)  v
(H1;3)(v) = (1 ?? 3)  v
(H2;3)(v) = (2 ?? 3)  v
Thus, (1 ?? 2) 2 Z, (1 ?? 3) 2 Z and (2 ?? 3) 2 Z and therefore 2 =
1 + a; 3 = 1 + b, with a; b 2 Z. We deduce
 = 1L1 + 2L2 + 3L3
= 1  (L1 + L2 + L3) + a  L2 + b  L3 (a; b 2 Z)
= a  L2 + b  L3Lie Algebras a crash course 27
In the last step we have used identity (1.19).
Here we see explicitly that the weights lie in a real subspace in h.
The linear combinations of the Li's with integer coecients form a lattice W 
h which is the so called weight lattice.
In the case of irreducible representations we can state the following proposition
as a consequence of the claim above.
Proposition 7. All weights of an irreducible representation of sl(3;C) are elements
of the weight lattice W and are congruent modulo the root lattice R (i.e.,
they dier by an integral linear combination of Li ?? Lj).
The Interior of the convex Hull
Let us reveal the interior of the convex hull enclosing all weights of a certain
representation.
The subspace
W =
M
k2Z
V+k(Li??Lj )
of V is a representation space of a representation of sL1??L2
=
sl(2;C). According
to theorem 4, there exists an upper and lower bound k1 and k2 of k 2 Z, such
that V+k(Li??Lj ) 6= f0g for all k 2 fk1; k1 + 1;    ; k2 ?? 1; k2g. If we choose 
on the boundary of the convex hull, we recognize that there is a corresponding
weight 'on the other side' of the convex hull (this is meant wrt. an arbitrary
(i; j)-direction). It follows from the main theorem in the discussion of sl(2;C)
that the weights of a representation of sl(2;C) form an unbroken string. The
space in between of these two 'boundary-weights' has to be lled up with other
weights (according to the remark before) such that the weights are congruent
modulo R. We get the complete weight diagram (shown in gure 1.8) if we
repeat this procedure for every 'boundary-weight' and every direction parallel to
the lattice W.
Thus, we have proven the following proposition.
Proposition 8. Let  be an arbitrary irreducible representation of sl(3;C). Let
 2 h be an 'extremal weight' ('extremal' means that jl()j is maximal with l
denoting an arbitrary linear functional as in (1.29)). Then all the weights lie in
W, are congruent modulo R and are enclosed by the convex hull whose vertices
are the images of  under the reections at the three lines fL 2 hj  Hi;j ;L =
0g.
The Highest Weight Theorem
Assume that we are working with the specic form of the linear functional l
given in (1.29). From the observation in the last subsection about the shape of28 Topology in Physics
Figure 1.8 Complete weight diagram
the convex hull enclosing all weights (compare observation 7), we know that all
possible highest weights must lie in the 60-sector shown in gure 1.9. Thus,
Observation 8. Every highest weight must be of the form (note that L2 = ??L1??
L3)
(a + b)L1 + bL2 = aL1 ?? bL3
for a; b being non-negative integers.
Before we continue, we have to state a basic proposition about products of
representations of Lie algebras and about the dual representation of a Lie algebra.
Proposition 9. Let 1, 2 and  be representations of a Lie algebra g with
representation space V . Then
 (1 
 2)(g) = 1(g) 
 1 + 1 
 2(g) (representation space V 
 V ),
 (1 ^ 2)(g) = 1(g) ^ 1 + 1 ^ 2(g) (representation space V ^ V ),
 (1
sym2)(g) = 1(g)
sym1+1
sym2(g) (representation space V 
symV )
 (g) = ??T (g) (representation space V ),
for all g 2 g.
This proposition is proven in the appendix.
Corollary 5. Let 1, 2 and  be representations of a Lie algebra g with representation
space V . ThenLie Algebras a crash course 29
Figure 1.9 Locus of the highest weight vectors
 The weights of the representation 1
2 are the pairwise sum of the weights
of the representations 1 and 2.
 The weights of the representation 1 ^ 2 are the pairwise sum of distinct
weights of the representations 1 and 2.
 The weights of the representation 1 
sym 2 are the pairwise sum of the
weights of the representations 1 and 2.
 The weights of the representation  are the negative weights of the representation
.
Proof. We conne us to the proof of the second assertion. Let w1 be an eigenvector
for 1(g) with eigenvalue  and let w2 be an eigenvector for 2(g) with
eigenvalue . Then
(1 ^ 2)(g)(w1 ^ w2) = (1(g) ^ 1)(w1 ^ w2) + (1 ^ 2(g))(w1 ^ w2)
= [1(g)(w1)] ^ w2 + w1 ^ [2(g)(w2)]
=   w1 ^ w2 +   w1 ^ w2
= [ + ]  w1 ^ w2
Assume w2 = w2 ) w1 ^w2 = w1 ^w1 = 0. Thus, the weights of the representation
1 ^ 2 are the pairwise sum of distinct weights of the representations
1 and 2.
Corollary 6. Let 1 and 2 be two representations of sl(3;C). Let v1 and v2 be
the highest weight vectors with corresponding highest weights 1 and 2. Then
v1 
 v2 is a highest weight vector for 1 
 2 with highest weight 1 + 2.30 Topology in Physics
Figure 1.10 Weight diagram for the standard representation 
Let us examine the consequences for some specic representations which will
be useful later on.
Let  be the standard representation of sl(3;C) on C3. Since h is the space
of diagonal matrices given in (1.19), the weight vectors are the standard basis
vectors e1, e2 and e3 with corresponding weights L1, L2 and L3. This yields the
diagram given in gure 1.10.
The diagram for the dual representation  is shown in gure 1.11 (compare
the corollary 5).
We immediately deduce the form of the diagrams corresponding to Sym2(),
Sym2(), Sym3(), Sym3(), ... (compare gure 1.12, gure 1.13, gure 1.14
and 1.15). We recognize that the symmetric powers Symn() and Symm()
yield exactly the triangular diagrams discussed in observation 7. Thus, Symn()
and Symm() are irreducible, since all the weights have multiplicity 1 (i.e., they
can't be a sum of irreducible diagrams).
Furthermore, Symn() has highest weight n  L1 and Symm() has highest
weight (??m)  L3.
This enables us to construct representations of sl(3;C) with arbitrary highest
weight aL1??bL3 by tensor products between Symn() and Symm() (compare
observation 8 and corollary 6).
We are ready now to state the following important theorem.
Theorem (Highest Weight Theorem). Let a and b be two non-negative integers.
Then there exists a unique irreducible, nite-dimensional representation
??a;b of sl(3;C) with highest weight aL1 ?? bL3.
Proof. We have to prove the existence and the uniqueness of the irreducible
representation ??a;b.Lie Algebras a crash course 31

Existence We have just learned that Syma()
Symb() has the desired highest
weight. According to proposition 6, Syma()
Symb() contains an irreducible
subrepresentation with the desired highest weight.
Uniqueness Assume that there would exist another irreducible representation
~??
a;b with the same highest weight. Let v and ~v denote the highest weight vectors
of ??a;b and ~
??
a;b respectively and with representation spaces V and ~ V respectively.
Then (v; ~v) is a highest weight vector of ??a;b~
??
a;b with highest weight aL1??bL3.
Let   ??a;b  ~
??
a;b be the irreducible representation with a representation space
U generated by the highest weight vector (v; ~v) (compare proposition 6). The
projections 1  U ! V and 2  U ! ~ V are non-zero linear maps. Furthermore,
1   = ??a;b  1 and 2   = ~
??
a;b  2. Therefore, we can apply Schur's lemma
to get that 1 and 2 are isomorphisms which implies that ??a;b
=

a;b (compare
section 7).
Corollary 7. The irreducible representation ??a;b is an irreducible subrepresentation
of Syma() 
 Symb().
Let us now describe the relation between ??a;b and Syma() 
 Symb().
Proposition 10. Assume that b  a. Then

Observation 9. The multiplicities of ??a;b increase by one on each hexagon of
the weight diagram and are constant on each triangle (without proof ).
To nish this section we state an algorithm to decompose an arbitrary representation
 of sl(3;C) into irreducible representations34 Topology in Physics
1. Determine the decomposition of  into weight spaces.
2. Find the highest weight  = aL1 ?? bL3 of .
3. Dene ~ such that  = ~  ??a;b. The weight diagram of  'minus' the
weight diagram of ??a;b is the weight diagram of ~.
4. Repeat this process for ~.
5 The Analysis of General Simple Lie Algebras
The procedure carried out in the last section to analyze sl(3;C) can be generalized
to an algorithm for the analysis of general complex semisimple Lie algebras. Each
of the following subsections (until the subsection about the Killing form) stands
for one step in the general algorithm. We will omit the general proofs.
Verication of the semisimplicity of the Lie algebra
Semisimplicity is crucial for the following discussion. If the Lie algebra g is not
semisimple, one can restrict the analysis to the semisimple part of g to get the
irreducible representations of g (compare theorem 3).
Determination of the Cartan subalgebra h  g
Denition (Cartan Subalgebra). Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra.
Then a Cartan subalgebra h  g is a complex subalgebra which is maximally
commuting and whose action is diagonalizable in an arbitrary faithful representation.
The dimension of h is the so called rank of g.
'Maximally commuting' means if we add only one element in g n h to h we
loose the commutativity of h.
A representation is called 'faithful', if its homomorphism is one-to-one. From the
Jordan decomposition theorem in section 2 we deduce that the Cartan subalgebra
is diagonalizable in every faithful representation. Especially, the action of h is
diagonalizable in the adjoint representation.
All elements in h are simultaneously diagonalizable since they commute.
Decomposition of g into a direct sum of root spaces
Compare denition 17 and denition 18 for the terms 'weight', 'weight space',
'multiplicity', 'root', 'root space'.
In regard of the adjoint representationLie Algebras a crash course 35
The adjoint action of h on g is diagonalizable. Thus, g decomposes into the
direct sum of its root spaces
g = h  (
M
g)
ad(H)(X) = (H)  X; (1.30)
for all H 2 h and X 2 g. The index  in the direct sum ranges over the nite
set R  h of all roots. Note that h = g0.
The calculation (1.25) proves that
ad(g)  g ! g+ (1.31)
We state without general proof the following properties of the conguration of
the roots in h
Observation 10. 1. Every root space g is one-dimensional.
2. The rank of the root lattice R  h generated by the roots is equal to the
dimension of h.
3. The set R of all roots is symmetric about the origin, i.e.  2 R ) ?? 2 R.
In regard of a general representation
Let  be an arbitrary representation of a Lie algebra g with representation
space V . Then the representation space V decomposes into a direct sum of weight
spaces V
V =
M
V
(H)(v) = (H)  v; (1.32)
for all H 2 h and all v 2 V.
The fundamental calculation (1.26) proves that
(g)  V ! V+ (1.33)
Let us assume that  is irreducible. Thus, there must not be any invariant subspace
wrt. the action of g. Together with (1.26) we deduce that the weights of
an irreducible representation are congruent modulo the root lattice R.
Like in the discussion of sl(3;C) we can draw the so called weight diagram (compare
for example gure 1.8).36 Topology in Physics
Determination of subalgebras isomorphic to sl(2;C
An important step in the discussion of sl(3;C) was the discovery of subalgebras
of sl(3;C) which were isomorphic to sl(2;C). Dene
s = g  g??  [g; g??] (1.34)
Then s is a subalgebra of g which is isomorphic to sl(2;C) (without proof). Note
that g, g?? are one-dimensional and that [g; g??] is at most one-dimensional
(compare observation 10).
We can chose a basis X 2 g, Y 2 g?? and H 2 [g; g??] satisfying the commutation
relations of sl(2;C). This determines H (it must take the eigenvalues
2 and (-2) on g and g?? respectively, i.e., (H) = 2).
The weight lattice W
In the discussion of sl(2;C) we learned that the eigenvalues of H are integervalued
in any representation. In the present case of s this means that the
eigenvalues of the action H are integer-valued in any representation of s.
In particular, the eigenvalues of the action of all elements H 2 h found in
subsection 5 must be integer-valued in any representation of g.
Therefore, every weight  2 h of every representation of g must yield integers
when evaluated on any of the H's. The weights with this property form a lattice
in h called the weight lattice W of g.
Note First, all weights of all representations of g lie in W and second, R 2
W ) R  W.
Symmetry under the Weyl group
The pairing  H;   (H) between elements in h and elements in h can be
considered as a scalar product between ,  2 h.
We dene the reections W() in the plane 
 = f 2 hj  H;  = 0g
parallel to 
W() =  ?? 2 
 H;  
 H;  
 
=  ?? 2 
(H)
(H)
 
=  ?? (H)   (1.35)
(Recall from subsection 5 that (H) = 2.)
Denition (Weyl Group). Let  be a weight of an arbitrary representation of
g. Then all the reections
W() =  ?? (H)  
generate a group of reections in h called the Weyl group W.Lie Algebras a crash course 37
Let us break up the set of weights into equivalence classes
[] = fweights  j  =  + n  ; n 2 Zg (1.36)
Similarly,
V[] =
M
n2Z
V+n (1.37)
Each of these spaces V[] realizes a representation of the subalgebra s  g when
we restrict the original representation space V to V[], since V[] is closed under
the action of s (compare (1.33)).
Proposition 11. The set of weights of any representation of g is invariant under
the Weyl group W.
Proof. It is possible to explicitly write down the whole string of weights that
correspond to nonzero summands in (1.37)...
When we shift the representant  of the equivalence class to 'the boundary' ~  of
the string and write down the whole string as
~ ; ~  + ; ~  + 2;    ; ~  + m
for an integer m  0. Then we arrive at the following string of integers
~ (H); ( ~  + )(H) = ~ (H) + 2;    ; ( ~  + m)(H) = ~ (H) + 2m
According to theorem 4, this string of integers has to be symmetric about the
origin of Z, i.e.,
~ (H) = ??( ~ (H) + 2m) ) ~ (H) = ??m 2 Z (1.38)
Thus, the whole string of weights corresponding to nonzero summands in (1.37)
is
~ ; ~  + ; ~  + 2;    ; ~  ?? ~ (H) (1.39)
In particular,
W( + k  )   + k ?? ( + k)(H)  H
=  + (m ?? k)  
The same consideration shows that the multiplicities are symmetric wrt. the
action of the Weyl group. This implies that the set of weights is invariant under
the Weyl group.
At this point we can introduce the so called Killing form on g. The Killing
form on g is an inner product on h with the characteristic property that it is
the unique inner product on h which is preserved under the action of the Weyl
group W (i.e., the Weyl group acts as a group of orthogonal transformations).
Equivalently, we could say that the Killing form is the unique inner product for
which the line in h spanned by  is perpendicular to the plane 
. Thus, the
Weyl group is the group of transformations generated by the reections in the
planes 
 perpendicular to the root .38 Topology in Physics
Ordering of the roots; the highest weight vector
As in the discussion of sl(3;C) we dene a linear functional l, such that its kernel
doesn't intersect the root lattice R. This yields a decomposition
R = R+ [ R??;
where R+ = froots  j l()  0g and R?? = froots  j l()  0g.
Denition 20. Let  be an arbitrary representation of g with representation
space V . Then a vector v 2 V is called a highest weight vector if v is simultaneously
a weight vector and gets killed by the action of (g) for all  2 R+. The
weight  corresponding to v is called the highest weight.
Proposition 12. Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra.
1. There exists a highest weight vector for every nite-dimensional representation
 of g.
2. Let  be a nite-dimensional representation of g with representation space
V and let W  V denote the vector space generated by the images of the
highest weight vector v under successive application of (g) for all  2 R??.
Then the restriction of the original representation  to the representation
space W  V is an irreducible subrepresentation of g.
3. The highest weight vector of an irreducible representation is unique (up to
multiplication with scalars).
A root  is called primitive of simple, if it can't be written as a sum of two
positive (respectively negative) roots.
Let us go over to the appearance of weight diagrams. As in the case of sl(3;C)
we make the following observation
Observation 11. The weights of a representation  are
1. congruent to the highest weight  modulo the root lattice R and
2. they lie in the convex hull with vertices being the images of  under the
Weyl group.
From what we have learned in (1.39) we deduce that the highest weight of a
representation is a weight satisfying (H)  0 for all  2 R+.
Denition 21. The set of points in the real span of the roots which satisfy the
inequalities (H)  0 for every  2 R+ is called the Weyl chamber W associated
to the specic ordering of the roots.
In terms of the Killing form, this is the set of points making an angle between 0
and 90 degrees with each positive root.Lie Algebras a crash course 39
Classication of the irreducible representations
We arrive at the fundamental theorem which we won't prove in general but it
should be evident after what we have done so far.
Theorem (Highest Weight Theorem). Let  2 h be a point in the intersection
between the Weyl chamber W (which is associated to a specic ordering of
the roots) and the weight lattice W.
Then there exists a unique irreducible, nite-dimensional representation ?? of g
with highest weight .
The weights of ?? are the elements of W congruent to  modulo the root lattice
R which are enclosed by the convex hull generated by the images of  under the
action of the Weyl group.
There always exist so called fundamental weights !1; !2;    !n, such that
every highest weight can be expressed as a linear combination of the fundamental
weights with non-negative, integer-valued coecients. (Geometrically these are
the weights on the edges of the Weyl chamber.) One usually writes ??a1;  ; an
instead of ?? if  = a1!1 +    + an!n.
Before we nish this section, we should say a few words about the Killing form
which we introduced in section 5.
The Killing Form
There are several dierent ways to dene the Killing form. We mention two
possibilities.
Denition (Killing Form (version 1)). The Killing form (; ) on g is the
symmetric bilinear form (hence an inner product) on g dened by
(X; Y ) = tr(ad(X)  ad(Y )  g ! g);
for all X and Y in g. This induces inner products on h and h respectively which
are denoted in the same way.
Denition (Killing Form (version 2)). The Killing form (; ) on g is the symmetric
bilinear form (hence an inner product) on g dened by the characteristic
property that the Killing form is invariant under the group of automorphisms on
g.
Note that the decomposition
g = h  (
M
2R
g)
is orthogonal according to the rst denition, since ad(g)  g ! g+.
One reason why we introduce the Killing form is the following proposition40 Topology in Physics
Proposition 13. The line in h spanned by a root  is perpendicular (wrt. the
Killing form (; )) to the hyperplane 
.
From this proposition one can deduce that the Weyl chamber is the set of
vectors in h which form an acute angle (wrt. (; )) with all positive roots.
Now we state an explicit isomorphism between h and h which is determined
by the Killing form.
Proposition 14. The isomorphism between h and h, which is determined by the
Killing form, maps an element  to
T =
2
(H;H)
 H
Conversely, the inverse isomorphism maps
H !
2
(; )
 
Using this notation, we dene the induced Killing form on h
(; ) = (T; T) (1.40)
From the orthogonality of the action of the Weyl group and (1.38) one can deduce
the next proposition.
Proposition 15. Let  and  be two roots. Then
2 
(; )
(; )
= (H)
is an integer.
6 The Classication of Complex Semisimple Lie Algebras
In the rst part of this section, we introduce and classify all Dynkin diagrams
whereas in the second part, we try to recover the Lie algebra from its corresponding
Dynkin diagram.
Dynkin Diagrams and their Classication
As we have already indicated, the roots span a real subspace of the Cartan
subalgebra h. On this space the Killing form is positive denite (without proof).
This real vector space together with the Killing form (; ) yields a Euclidean space
E. A positive root is called simple if it is not the sum of two other positive roots.
We list the central properties of a root systemLie Algebras a crash course 41
Proposition 16. Let R be a root system. Then
1. The root system R is a nite set and its elements span the Euclidean space
E.
2.  2 R ) ?? 2 R.
3. k   =2 R for all k 2 Z n f1g
4. The root system R is invariant under the action of the Weyl group W.
5. The quantity
n = 2 
(; )
(; )
is an integer for every ;  2 R.
6. Let  and  be two roots such that  6= . Then the -string through 
(i.e.,  ?? p;    ; ;    ;  + q) consists of at most four elements. Additionally,
p ?? q = n.
7. Let  and  be two roots such that  6= . Then
(; )  0 )  ??  is a root;
(; )  0 )  +  is a root
If (; ) = 0 , then  ??  and  +  are both roots or both aren't roots.
8. The angle between distinct simple roots cannot be acute.
9. The simple roots are linearly independent.
10. The number of simple roots is equal to n = dimC h = dimR E.
11. Every positive root can be written uniquely as a non-negative integral combination
of simple roots.
The integer n is called the rank of the Lie algebra or the root system.
The fth property implies a strong restriction on the possible geometric con-
gurations of the roots

Table 1.1 The geometry of the root system
is an integer between 0 and 4. All possible congurations are shown in the
following table.
We list all possible root systems of rank 1 and 2.
Rank 1. The only possible root system is the root system corresponding to
sl(2;C)
Rank 2. The root system for sl(2;C)  sl(2;C) = so4(C) is A1  A1. The root
system for sl(3;C) is A2. The root system for so5(C) = sp4(C) is B2. The root
system for the exceptional Lie algebra g2 is G2.
Denition 22. The direct sum of two root systems is a root system. A root
system is called irreducible if it is not a direct sum of two other root systems.Lie Algebras a crash course 43
Dynkin Diagrams. The Dynkin diagram for a certain root system is a diagram
consisting of nodes  for each simple root and lines joining them. The number
of lines between the nodes is dened by the angle  between the specic simple
roots. When there is more than one line joining two nodes then the corresponding
simple roots can have dierent length. In this case one includes an arrow into
the diagram pointing from the longer to the shorter simple root.
Note that a Dynkin diagram contains the knowledge of (i; j) for all i 6= j.
Two Dynkin diagrams are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-one onto map
of the nodes such that the number of lines between the nodes and such that the
direction of the arrows are preserved. The root diagrams are independent of the
specic ordering of the roots.
Now we state the crucial classication theorem which classies every irreducible
root system. Its proof is completely based on Euclidean geometry (compare
table 1.1).
Theorem (Classication of Dynkin Diagrams). The Dynkin diagrams given
in gure 1.16 are all possible Dynkin diagrams of irreducible root systems. With
the correspondences

(Bn) $ so2n+1(C)
(Cn) $ sp2n(C)
(Dn) $ sl2n(C)
To complete the classication of complex simple Lie algebras, we would have
to prove the following theorem
Theorem 5. 1. Let R1 and R2 be two root systems for two dierent Cartan
subalgebras of the same complex semisimple Lie algebra. Then R1 and R2
are isomorphic.44 Topology in Physics

3. Complex semisimple Lie algebras which have isomorphic root systems are

4. Every root system arises as the root system of a complex semisimple Lie
algebra.
A semisimple Lie algebra is determined (up to isomorphisms) by the speci-
cation of its simple summands.
Reconstruction of a Lie Algebra from its Dynkin Diagram
This section consists of two parts rst, we learn how to get the root system of a
given Dynkin diagram and second, we learn how to recover the Lie algebra from
its root system. Therefore, we will be able to reconstruct the Lie algebra from
its Dynkin diagram.Lie Algebras a crash course 45
Reconstruction of the root system from its Dynkin Diagram
The simple roots follow directly from the diagram; we denote them 1;    ; n.
According to 11th property of proposition 16, all positive roots can be written as
an integral linear combination with non-negative coecients. In the following, we
wPill try to answer the question Which non-negative integral linear combinations n
i=0mii are roots The answer to this question determines all the positive
roots and therefore the entire root system.
Let  =
Pn
i=0mii be any positive root. Then
Pn
i=0mi is the so called level of
.
Claim 3. 1. Every positive root  can be written in the form
 =  + j ;
where  is a root or 0 and j is a simple root.
2. Let  =
Pn
i=0mii be a positive root and let j be a simple root. Then
 +  is a root i
p  nj  2 

where p is the lower bound for the j-string, i.e.,
 ?? p;    ; ;    ;  + q
Furthermore, p  mj .
Proof. Let  =
Pn
i=1 rii be a positive root with level m + 1. Since the Killing
form is positive denite on the root system, we have
0  (; ) =
X
ri  (; i)
Thus, (; i)  0 for some i with ri  0 (if all quantities (; i) and ri were
negative, level m + 1 of  wouldn't be possible). Using the 7th property of
proposition 16, we deduce that  ?? i is a root. Therefore,  was of the form
 + j . This proves the rst statement.
Assume we would know all positive roots with level  m and let  be any positive
root with level m. Question Is  + j a root
If  + j is a root it has to be contained in the j-string
 ?? pj ;    ; ;    ;  + qj
through , i.e., we have to demand qj??string  0. This is equivalent to p  nj
(compare the 6th property of proposition 16).

Reconstruction of the simple Lie Algebra from its root system
The process of the reconstruction of the simple Lie Algebra from its root
system can be divided into three steps
1. Dene a basis of the Lie algebra.
2. Compute the entire multiplication table of all elements in the basis.
3. Check that the structure we have gotten (i.e., the vector space spanned by
the basis together with the multiplication table) really denes a simple Lie
algebra.
What one would have to prove is the following
1. The multiplication table is determined by the Dynkin diagram.
2. Existence There exists a simple Lie algebra for each Dynkin diagram.
3. Uniqueness The simple Lie algebra corresponding to a certain Dynkin
diagram is unique up to isomorphisms.
Now, we describe, how one can nd a basis of g.
Let 1;    ; n denote the simple roots which follow directly from the root
system. These simple roots realize a basis in h. After the discussion in the last
subsection we know how to get the entire root system from the set of simple
roots.
Let  2 R+ be an arbitrary positive root. The goal is to nd a basis for the
Cartan subalgebra h and every root space g (which are one-dimensional), since
g = h  (
M
g)
We need two ingredients to construct the basis. The rst one is the following
lemma.
Lemma 6. Let ,  6=  and  +  be roots. Then
[g; g] = g+
Proof. We have already seen that [g; g]  g+ and that all root spaces are
one-dimensional. What is left to show is that [g; g] 6= 0.
Consider the -string M
k2Z
g+kLie Algebras a crash course 47
If  6=  the -string realizes an irreducible representation of sl(2;C), since all
the root spaces in the string are one-dimensional.
Assume that [g; g] = 0. Then the following two parts of the string
M
n2
g+n
M
l0
g??l
wouldn't mix under the action of ad(g), i.e., they would realize subrepresentations
which is a contradiction to the observation of irreducibility above.
The second ingredient is the observation we made in the last subsection that
we can write the arbitrary positive root  in the form (compare claim 3)
 = i1 +    + ir ; (1.43)
such that
i1 +    + is (1.44)
is a root for every s 2 f1;    ; rg.
From these two ingredients we deduce the following
Once we have found the basis elements for all root spaces corresponding to simple
roots and for gi1+  +ir??1
, the basis element for g  gi1+  +ir follows
directly by the application of 'ad(basis of gir )', since
ad(gir )  gi1+  +ir??1
! gi1+  +ir
 g
Thus, to begin, we have to determine the basis for h and for all the simple root
spaces gi 
Choose Xi 2 gi and Yi 2 g??i arbitrarily. Dene Hi = [Xi; Yi]. Adjust Yi, such
that
[Hi;Xi] = 2  Xi and [Hi; Yi] = ??2  Yi
Therefore, spanfHi; Xi; Yig = si
=
sl(2;C).
We repeat this procedure for every simple root i. We nally get a basis for gi
and g??i for every 1  i  n and a basis for h (since dim h = dim h). Then we
can complete the basis of g as described above.

Starting with the fact that the Lagrangian of electrodynamics is
locally invariant under the transformation group U(1), i.e.  !
exp(i(x)), A ! A+ie@(x), the rst part of this report will
consider the opposite question of how possible Lagrangians that
have such an invariance might look like in general. Astonishingly,
we get quite similar results by replacing the Abelian group U(1)
with a general non-Abelian group G. Using these experiences,
in the second part we will consider the concept of spontaneous
symmetry breaking again in two parts. Firstly we will look at
the case of a global symmetry to be broken what leads us to
Goldstone's theorem and secondly we consider the case of a local
symmetry breaking, what leads us to the Higgs mechanism. This
important concept appears in many real physical problems and
we discuss briey this appearance in the electroweak theory and
in superconductivity. Write here a short summary of your talk. It
should contain all important informations and catch the readers
attention.

1 Non-Abelian gauge invariance
Motivation and conventions
Considering the Lorentz invariant Lagrangian density for scalar electrodynamics1,
one can see that it is locally gauge invariant under the group U(1), whereby
local gauge invariance means that the transformation can depend on the spacetime
point x, and global invariance would mean invariance under a constant
transformation.
In the rst section, we will derive the rather astonishing result that one can also
derive the Lagrangian density for scalar electrodynamics by only assuming this
local gauge invariance under U(1). This leads us to the idea that we might create
other interesting theories by using more general groups. So we will rst have a
look at the group SU(2) and then generalize the methods to a general symmetry
group.
We will use natural units (~ = 1 = c) and Einstein's sum convention in which
Greek indices run from (0; ; 3) and roman indices from (1; ; 3). In this section,
we follow [3] and [4].
Abelian gauge invariance - U(1) gauge theory
Starting with the complex-valued scalar eld , we assume that our theory has
to be invariant under the transformation
(x) ! V (x)(x) , V (x) = ei(x) 2 U(1) (2.1)
The phase rotation (x) is an arbitrary real function, depending on the point of
space-time, since we want to discuss a local gauge invariance. If we want to nd
out what kind of Lagrangian matches our requirement of local U(1) invariance,
we simply consider the dierent transformation behaviors of the possible terms
that a Lagrangian can have. Of course, if we only take U(1) invariant terms to
build a Lagrangian, we can ensure its local U(1) invariance.
First, we consider a mass term
m(x) (2.2)
We see that such terms are invariant under both global and local U(1) transformation
and do not need further considerations.

D = @ + iA and A the Lorentz covariant potential.Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 53
It becomes more interesting when we have a look at terms including derivatives
of . While the behavior under a global transformation is
@(x) ! V @(x),
the one under a local transformation is
@(x) ! V (x)@(x) + (x)@V (x)
The reason of the appearance of a second term becomes more clear if we have a
look at the denition of the derivative in a given direction n,
n@(x) = lim
!0


[(x + n) ?? (x)] (2.3)
We can see that, since the transformation (2.1) depends on the point in spacetime,
both summands have a completely dierent transformation under (2.1).
One idea to solve this problem is to introduce a factor U(y; x) called comparator
that compensates the dierence in phase transformations from one point to the
next with the transformation law
U(y; x) ! V (y)U(y; x)V (x)??1 (2.4)
This ensures that (x) and U(x; y)(y) transform in the same way. Of course,
the comparator has to ensure U(x; x) = 1. We can now dene an operator D
called covariant derivative

[(x + n) ?? U(x + n; x)(x)] (2.5)

U(x + n; x) = 1 ?? ienA(x) + O(2); (2.6)
in which the A is a new real vector eld called gauge eld or connection. Thus,
the covariant derivative takes the form
D(x) = @(x) + ieA(x)(x); (2.7)
and by inserting(2.6) into (2.4) and comparing the -coecients

Figure 2.1 square in the (1,2)-plane of space-time, used for the construction of
a eld strength
If we check the behavior of D under the local symmetry transformation (2.1) we
nd
D(x) ! e(i(x))@(x) + (x)@e(i(x)) + (ieA(x) ?? i@(x))e(i(x))(x)
= e(i(x))[@ + ieA](x);
hence
D(x) ! ei(x)D(x) (2.9)
Note that the denition of the covariant derivative as well as the existence and
the transformation law of the gauge eld A are a direct consequence of the
condition of the local symmetry. Without these constructs we would not be able
to write an invariant Lagrangian.
To complete the construction, we also need to nd locally invariant terms
that depend on A and its derivatives, but not on (x) itself. Once again, we
consider the comparator U(y; x). To simplify we make some assumptions about
U(y; x); it should be a pure phase U(y; x) = ei(y;x) with (y; x) an arbitrary real
function, and U(x; y)y = U(y; x). For  small, this leads to an approximation 2
U(x + n; x) = e??ienA(x+

Now consider a small square lying in the (1,2)-plane of the space-time with
unit vectors ^1 and ^2 (see Fig. 2.1). Dene U(x) as the product of four U(y; x) -
functions so that the new function U(x) is invariant under (2.1)
U(x) = U(x; x+^2)U(x+^2; x+^1 +^2)U(x+^1 +^2; x+^1)U(x+^1; x) (2.11)

and expanded
U(x) = 1 ?? ie2[@1A2(x) ?? @2A1(x)] + O(3) (2.12)
Since U(x) is locally invariant, F = @A(x) ?? @A(x) is so as well. F is
called eld strength tensor. If we think of the Lagrangian of electrodynamics, we
can see that F corresponds to the electromagnetic eld tensor.
A shorter approach of nding the invariance of F starts with the covariant
derivative since D(x) ! V (x)D(x)  [D;D](x) ! V (x)[D;D](x),
what implies that [D;D] is invariant under (2.1) 3. A closer look at the commutator
[D;D] shows that it is not a derivative at all
[D;D](x) = [@; @](x) + ie([@;A] ?? [@;A])(x)
??e2[A;A](x)
= ie(@A(x) ?? @A(x))(x);
and that with the denition of F we can write
[D;D] = ieF (2.13)
and that it is thus invariant.
We can now create a Lagrangian out of , D and of F and its derivatives.
When we assume that operators with dimension not larger than 4 make sure that
the theory keeps renormalizable, only 5 terms can appear
L = (D)D ??

4
(F)2 ?? icFF ?? m + a()2, (2.14)
where the ??1
4 in the second term is just conventional. The U(1) group, which
was a global symmetry has become a local symmetry group and is now called
gauged.
Note that we achieved this result only by assuming a local symmetry; furthermore,
the existence of an electromagnetic vector potential appears naturally. If
we insist on having a Lagrangian L that is also invariant under time reversal or
parity, the third term disappears and our construction remind us on the Lorentz
invariant Lagrangian density for scalar electrodynamics.
3this argument is only true when V(x) and [D;D] do commute. In the U(1) case this is
of course the case since V(x) is a scalar function. In the next section though, we will see that
this invariance is no more true.56 Topology in Physics
Non-Abelian Gauge Theory and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian
In this section, we want to generalize the methods of the previous section in
which we assumed the symmetry group to be the Abelian Group U(1). We now
want to consider a general group G as a symmetry group which is in particular
non-Abelian. Before we start to generalize the results from the previous section,
we rst write down some conditions on the general group and very briey some
facts about Lie algebras.
Mathematical concepts As we have seen in the last section, our gauge theory
is related to a symmetry group, which we had to gauge. In order to use similar
methods like we did in the Abelian case, the symmetry group G must be at
least a continuous group. We actually focus our attention only on continuously
generated groups, which means that the group contains elements arbitrarily close
to the identity. This condition allows us to write an innitesimal group element
g in the form of
g() = 1 + iaXa + O(2) , Xa 2 Lie(G) (2.15)
The set of generators Xa span a vector space4, and so the commutator of generators
Xa is a linear combination of generators,
[Xa;Xb] = ifabcXc (2.16)
in which the fabc are called structure constants.
We can choose Xa to be a set of hermitian generators 5 and because of the Jacobi
identity of the Xa , [Xa; [Xb;Xc]] + [Xb; [Xc;Xa]] + [Xc; [Xa;Xb]] = 0 we get
fadefbcd + fbdefcad + fcdefabd = 0; (2.17)
where it can be proved that fabc are totally antisymmetric.
Another nice concept we will use is the irreducible representation ad of a
Group G, called the adjoint representation whose denition is
G ! Aut(V ) ; g 7! (v 7! gvg??1) (2.18)
The representation matrices of the associated representation of the Lie algebra
of G are given by the structure constants,
((Xb))ac = ifabc ; Xb 2 Lie(G) (2.19)
4Note that the denition of a generator A of a group element a is here the equation a = eiA
and not eA.
5We know that there is a scalar product in the representational vector space for every
representation of the group G such that the representational matrix is unitary. According to
this fact, the generators of G can be represented by hermitian matrices Xa.Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 57
Methods of generalization illustrated by the group SU(2) We are now
ready to generalize the methods to a general symmetry group G. Because SU(2)
is a well known example for such a group, we will apply the results to this group
to illustrate the eect more concretely.
We start now with the more general situation using a set of N elds instead
of a single eld
(x) =
0
B@
1(x)
...

(2.20)
For the SU(2) case, it is enough to have N = 2,
(x) =
1(x)
2(x)
!
 (2.21)
(x) transforms analogously to the Abelian case,
(x) ! V (x) (x) , V (x) = exp(ia(x)Xa) 2 G (2.22)
where Xa are the hermitian generators of the group G and the index a goes from
1; ; dim(G).
For G = SU(2), we have Xa = a
2 with j ; (j = 1; 2; 3) the hermitian Pauli spin
matrices. Expanding V (x) for a small  yields
V (x) = 1 + ia(x)Xa + O(2) (2.23)
Now we want to gauge the group by changing (2.22) into a local symmetry group.
This can be ensured by insisting on the condition that the Lagrangian should be
invariant under (2.22) for  = (x) an arbitrary function of x. We will now try
to use the same methods as in the previous section, in which our symmetry group
was U(1). One fundamental dierence is that the generators Xa do not have to
commute as in the Abelian case. For G = SU(2) this is the case since the Pauli
matrices do not commute.
In general, the eld theory with a non-commuting local symmetry is called a
non-Abelian gauge theory.
Exactly as in the Abelian case, we introduce a comparator U(y; x), but since
is a N component object, U(y; x) has to be a N  N matrix. Again we claim
U(x; x) = id and the transformation law to be
U(y; x) ! V (y)U(y; x)V (x)y (2.24)
Assuming U(y; x) to be a unitary matrix, we can expand U(y; x) in terms of the
hermitian generators of G, and for a small distance between the two points x and
y, we have
U(x + n; x) = id + ignA

The constant g is extracted and we will use it later. As one can see, the new
elds A are elements of the Lie algebra Lie(G),

and the A
a are called Yang-Mills elds. For G = SU(2) we get analogously

then we get a new expression for the covariant derivative

In order to check that the new covariant derivative transforms as
D (x) ! V (x)D (x) (2.31)
one might use (2.29) and show it in a straight forward way. This calculation is
not so easy, because there are lots of matrices that do not commute with each
other. Since our construction (2.5) does not need such a verication, we leave
the calculation to those who do not believe 6.
Again, we need to nd gauge-invariant terms that depend only on A. Inspired
by the Abelian case, we consider the commutator of covariant derivatives
and its transformation
[D;D] (x) ! V (x)[D;D] (x) (2.32)
Just as in the Abelian case, we can show that [D;D] is not a dierential operator
anymore but only a multiplicative factor in form of a N  N matrix which does
not commute with the matrix V (x) anymore
[D;D] = ??igF

equation (2.35) for the SU(2) case looks the same, we only have to replace Xa
by j
2 .
From the equations (2.24) (2.32) and (2.33) we can conclude that the new eld
strength tensor transforms according to the adjoint representation

Note that the eld strength tensor is no longer gauge-invariant, since the factors
(matrices!) in equation (2.36) do not commute anymore. However, in an appropriate
normalization, we can still nd gauge-invariant terms out of the eld
strength tensor, for example the term
tr[(F

(F

Such a term in a Lagrangian would describe a nontrivial, interacting eld theory,
because it contains cubic and quartic terms in A
a. Such a theory is called Yang-
Mills theory.
Using the equations (2.30) and (2.37), it is possible to show that any globally
symmetric function of , F
a and their covariant derivatives is also locally
symmetric, and might possibly appear in a Lagrangian.
However, as we have already seen in equation (2.14), in a renormalizable theory,
not so many terms are possible, and under the assumption that our Lagrangian
preserves time reversal and parity, only four terms are allowed

Now we want to adjust the covariant derivative on the adjoint representation,
that means if a eld (x) does not transform the way equation (2.1) shows, but
in the adjoint representation, we want D acting on (x) to respect that, in the way
that the second term of D should act on the eld (x) according to the adjoint
representation and its corresponding Lie algebra representation  respectively,
(D)a = @a ?? igA
b((Xb))acc = @a + gfabcA
bc; (2.43)
where we used equation (2.19). Together with equation (2.43) we can write
equation (2.30) in the new form
A

(D)a (2.44)
and equation (2.37) becomes
(DF)a = ??gj
a (2.45)
One can see that with this generalization of the covariant derivative - now it
respects the transformation behaviors of the elds it acts on - the strange-looking
terms involving fabc are gone and even for a general symmetry group G we receive
the same results as in the previous sections only by generalizing the covariant
derivative.
To nish this section, we want to show that there is, of course, an analogue
of the homogeneous Maxwell equations in electrodynamics7 . We rst consider
the antisymmetric double commutator of covariant derivatives
[D; [D;D]] = 0 (2.46)
The term vanishes because of its total antisymmetry8. Since we know that
[D;D] = ??igF
aXa, equation (2.46) can be reduced to
(DF)a = 0 (2.47)
which is the equation corresponding to the homogeneous Maxwell equation.
7 Remember that also in the classical electrodynamic theory, the homogeneous Maxwell
equation do not follow from the Euler-Lagrange equations. Because the eld strength tensor
F is dened by the Lorentz invariant potential A, the homogeneous Maxwell equation follows
automatically.
8Since  is a total antisymmetric tensor with 1234 = 1, only 3! terms are non-zero when
the rst component is xed. If for example we x the 4th coecient,
4123 = 4231 = 4312 = ??1 , 4213 = 4132 = 4321 = 1 , and the rest all zero.Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 61

Everything in this chapter will be done for classical eld theory except for the
particle interpretation out of a Lagrangian density. Our results are therefore not
completely correct, but one might see that what we derive can be interpreted as
the rst terms in a quantum expansion. A discussion of quantum corrections is
done in [4].
Spontaneous symmetry breaking
In the context of Lagrangians with scalar potentials, spontaneous symmetry
breakdown is dened as follows
Given that we have a rigid group G and a potential V () that is group invariant
under this group, i.e.
V (U(g)) = V () (2.48)
for U(g) a unitary, continuous representation of G. If the point (x) = 0 where
V () takes its minimum is not G invariant, i.e.
U(g)0 6= 0 for g 2 G, (2.49)
then the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken.
A visual example of the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry is given in [6]
Imagine an innite crystalline array of spin-1
2 magnetic dipoles that are interacting
with their nearest neighbors. Even though the Hamiltonian is rotationally
invariant, the ground state is not because it is a state in which all the dipoles
are aligned in some arbitrary direction and is innitely degenerate for an innite
ferromagnet 9 . Now imagine a little (i.e.  1) man living inside this huge
crystal. He would denitely have a hard time to nd out that the laws of nature
are rotational invariant. As long as his experiments interact even just a little
bit with the background eld, he might detect rotational invariance only as an
approximate symmetry. He would have no reasons to suspect that it was in fact
an exact symmetry. The idea that the little man could check that he lives in
a innitely degenerated ground state and therefore misses a symmetry is good
but an impossible task for a little man, since he had to change the directions of
innitely many spins at the time.
Therefore

because of the Jacobi identity.
9 Because the ferromagnet is innite, there are no special directions for the spins to align.
Every direction is possible and so, there are innitely many ground states.62 Topology in Physics

Like the little man who lives in the crystal, missing the rotational symmetry, we
assume that our laws of nature may possess symmetries which are not manifest
to us because our vacuum state is not invariant under them. With vacuum state
is meant the state of lowest energy, and we characterize the spectra of small oscillations
around the vacuum as particle masses.
This idea that we might miss a symmetry is one of the main motivations for the
further discussion.

2; (2.52)
where  is a positive number and 2 might be positive or negative. We can easily
see the symmetry
 ! ?? (2.53)
If 2 is positive, then the potential looks like the one in Fig. 2.4. The vacuum
is then at 0 = 0 and the symmetry is not broken and the mass of the particle
corresponding to the eld  is .
If 2 is negative (see Fig. 2.5), it is convenient to introduce a quantity
c2 = ??

(2.54)Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 63
and the potential can be written as
V () =

4!
(2 ?? c2)2 (2.55)
plus an irrelevant constant. One can see from equation (2.55) that the potential
has two minima,  = c. Which one we choose does not matter, the symmetry
is spontaneously broken anyway. So we choose  = c and dene a new, shifted
eld
0 =  ?? c (2.56)
In terms of this shifted eld, the potential is
V () =



4!
04 +
c
6
03 +
c2
6
02 (2.57)
We can see here, that the squared of the mass of the particle that corresponds to
the eld 0 is c2
3 and not 2 = c2
6 as one might think by considering equation
(2.50) and (2.52). Of course we have to be careful by interpreting particles out of
a Lagrangian density, because our vacuum state might not be at 0 = 0. In such
a case we need to expand the Lagrangian around 0 because in our denition of
particles we consider the neighborhood of the vacuum state, just the way we did
it here.
Note also that a cubic  term appears, which makes it hard to detect the hidden
symmetry
0 ! ??(0 + 2c) (2.58)
So here we can see, that for such a system with spontaneous symmetry breaking,
we might have two Lagrangians (here (2.50) and (2.57)) describing the same
system, but in one we can see easily the symmetry and in one the particles.

One possible vacuum state is the constant (x) = 0, such that V (0) is at
its smallest value. If 0 6= 0, then 0 is not invariant under a global phase64 Topology in Physics

transformation, hence the symmetry is spontaneously broken. The lowest state
is again innitely degenerated because the phase of 0 is arbitrary.
We want to x a potential
V () = 2 + ()2 + const (2.62)
and get the equation of motion
(@@ + 2) = ??22 (2.63)
by using the Euler-Lagrange equations.
If  = 0 and 2  0, the Lagrangian contains no terms representing interaction
and we get the plane waves of wave vectors k with k2 = 2 corresponding to a
single-particle state of mass .
If   0 and 2  0 the potential looks like Fig. 2.2 and the lowest solution is
(x) = 0 what corresponds to no spontaneous symmetry breaking.
If   0 and 2  0 the potential looks like Fig. 2.3 and we can already see that
the lowest solution (x) = 0 6= 0 and so the symmetry is spontaneously broken.
We want to study this case now.
The potential is dened only up to a constant, so that we can rewrite it in the
form
V () = ( ?? 20)2 + const ; 0 6= 0 (2.64)
and the lowest state corresponds to  = 20
, or
(x) = 0ei0 (2.65)
with 0 an arbitrary real constant.
We expand (x) around the vacuum solution 0
(x) = (0 + (x))ei(x) ; (0) = 0 (2.66)
and the complex elds (x) and (x) are then replaced by real elds (x) and
(x). The Lagrange density changes to

the -eld appears in the Lagrangian only by its derivatives. These modes
are illustrated in Fig. 2.6.
There exists a nice way in which we could have seen purely geometrically that
there must enter a massless particle term in the Lagrangian. If our vacuum is not
invariant under the symmetry group U(1) we have a curve in an abstract space of
all states passing through all the possible vacuum states. In our case, the curve
is a circle in the complex plane as drawn in Fig. 2.6. If we expand the potential
around the vacuum, no terms involving the variable that measures displacement
along this curve can appear, because the potential is constant along this curve.
Since this curve is parametrized by the function (x), and (x) appears in the
Lagrangian by its derivatives, we always have a massless particle.
Such a massless particle is called a Goldstone boson, what leads us to the next
section.
10 If we drop the second order term in  as well, we will loose the information how the system
behaves around the vacuum solution since the Euler-Lagrange equations kill one .66 Topology in Physics
Goldstone's Theorem and Goldstone bosons
In the last example of the previous section, we have seen that the spontaneous
breakdown of a global symmetry implies the existence of a massless particle called
Goldstone boson. One should remember that the symmetry that is spontaneously
broken is still a symmetry of the system. It is manifested not through the invariance
of the lowest state, but in the Goldstone mode - through the existence of
a Goldstone boson.
In this section we want to give an idea of the general version of that statement
called Goldstone's theorem.
We start with a Lagrangian that is globally invariant under the symmetry
group G and assume to have a set of N real elds, and a potential V ( ) which
is invariant under a group transformation
(x) ! eiaXa
(x) and so V ( ) = V (eiaXa
(x)); (2.69)
where the Xa are a set of N hermitian matrices and the a are arbitrary real
parameters.
Now we want to construct the subgroup H of G that contains all the elements
of G that leave the vacuum state 0 of the Lagrangian invariant 11 . H does
of course depend on the potential V () and may be anything from the trivial
identity subgroup (all symmetries spontaneously broken) to the full group (no
symmetries spontaneously broken). We want to choose the indices of the group
generators so that this subgroup H is generated by the rst N ?? K generators
where N  N ?? K  0. Formally, this means
H = fh 2 Gjh 0 = 0g and Xa 0 = 0 8a 6 N ?? K (2.70)
Now the K remaining generators do not leave 0 invariant, and according to the
discussion at the end of the previous chapter, in the abstract space of all states,
we have a K-dimensional surface of constant potential V ( ). Thus, by the same
geometrical arguments as before 12 , the theory must contain K massless particles,
one for each spontaneously broken symmetry. As we said before, these particles
are called Goldstone Bosons and the statement we just proved is a special case
(the classical case) of Goldstone's theorem, that can be proved in much greater
generality in quantum eld theory13 .
11 It is easy to see that this is in fact a subgroup (see also chapter little group).
12 A more mathematical proof is done in [7], p.93.
13See [6], p.120
given a eld theory obeying the usual axioms (Lorentz invariance, locality, Hilbert space with
positive-denite inner product, etc.), if there is a local conserved current (the axiomatic version
of the statement that the Lagrangian is invariant under some continuous transformation) such
that the space integral of its time component does not annihilate the vacuum state, then the
theory necessarily contains a massless spinless meson, with the same internal symmetry and
parity properties as the time component of the current.Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 67
Higgs mechanism
In the very beginning of this report, we have seen that there are certain Lagrangians
that are invariant not only under a global symmetry transformation,
but also under a local one. From the previous section we know that there are
spontaneous symmetry breakings, but we discussed that phenomenon only in case
of a global gauge invariance. In this section, we will discuss the case of a local
gauge invariance in an Abelian and a non-Abelian example.

The gauge eld A transforms according to equation (2.8) and the eld  according
to equation (2.1).
Using the Hamiltonian of the Lagrangian (2.71), it is possible to show 14 that a
lowest energy solution is
A(x) = 0 and (x) = 0ei0 (2.72)
where 0 is an arbitrary constant, and since 0 6= 0 we see that there is a spontaneous
symmetry breaking for all 0 and without loss of generality we choose
0 = 0.
Considering the close neighborhood of the vacuum state 0, we write (x) =
0 + (x) with (x) = 1(x) + i2(x) and get the Lagrangian

As in the previous section, we call the local gauge symmetry spontaneously broken
when 0 6= 0. A vacuum solution is  = 0 and A = 0. This follows from the
equations of motion (see equation (2.78)). Because 0 6= 0, we get a spontaneous
symmetry breaking to discuss.
Again we consider the eld (x) in a close neighborhood of the vacuum state 0,
(x) = 0 + (x); (2.76)

By comparing the two Lagrangians (2.73) and (2.77) we recognize that in (2.73),
there appears a massless particle (Goldstone Boson) according to the eld 2 but
there is no such massless particle in (2.77) anymore. Since the second Lagrangian
(2.77) is reached by a local gauge transformation, we can see that the Goldstone
boson can be gauged away.
So the Goldstone Boson is just a so-called gauge phantom and by using the
right gauge transformation, it disappears. Now we want to investigate the form
of the gauge elds A in this gauge, because once we have chosen the gauge
transformation for  it is xed for the elds A as well.
Using the Euler-Lagrange equations, we get the equations of motion
@F = ??2e22A ; (@ + ieA)(@ + ieA) = 2(20
?? 2) (2.78)
Expanding the equations of motion in the regime where  and A are small
quantities leads us to the new equations of motion
(@@ + 2e220
)A = 0 ; @A = 0 and (2.79)
(@@ + 420
) = 0
Here we can see that the massless particle appears no more but the gauge eld
A has become massive because of the non-zero coecient 2e220
that corresponds
with the squared value of the mass. The conclusion can be shown in the following
way at the beginning we can choose a xed gauge so that the original independent
elds are A1;A2 and ; . With the expansion around the vacuum state
and using the gauge which changes the eld  into a real eld , we replace the
original elds by A1;A2;A3 and . Now we can see that the Goldstone boson,
which is in fact just a gauge phantom, has been eaten by the gauge eld and
that one gets a massive gauge eld. This magic trick was discovered by P.Higgs
(and independently by other people) and it is called the Higgs mechanism. Some
more discussion can be found at section 2 after we will have also considered the
Higgs mechanism for a general non-Abelian gauge group.Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 69
The little group Before we have a look at one example of the Higgs mechanism
of a non-Abelian local gauge transformation, we want to discuss briey a
useful concept called the little group.
We assume that only some spin-0 elds, Higgs elds, can have non-vanishing vacuum
values, and therefore cause spontaneous symmetry breaking. The reason is
that higher-spin elds which cause spontaneous symmetry breaking would spontaneously
break the Lorentz invariance in contradiction to experimental evidence.
We will use the same Lagrangian (2.71) and write  for the Higgs elds. The
potential V () has its minimum at (x) = 0 with the minimum value zero
V (0) = 0; V 0(0) = 0; V 00(0)  0 (2.80)
As we know, spontaneously symmetry breaking happens if 0 6= 0 and a vacuum
solution is
(x) = 0 and Aa
(x) = 0 () D(x) = 0) (2.81)
As we have seen earlier in the U(1) case, 0 is not the only possible vacuum state
because ei0 for an arbitrary  would do it as well. The same happens for a
spontaneously symmetry breaking in the non-Abelian gauge theory, and we want
to discuss it the same way as in the Abelian case.
First, we specify that 0 is constant 6= 0, which means that all the components of
0 are independent of space-time points x. Since we assume the potential V to be
independent of x, this is indeed possible. As we have seen in earlier sections, there
might be certain elements h 2 G for that h0 builds another possible vacuum
state. Consider now the elements ~h of G, that leave 0 invariant, such that
the two vacuum states 0 and ~h0 do not dier. Because we assume to have a
spontaneous symmetry breakdown, this must not hold for all the elements g of
the local gauge transformation Group G. We call the set of the elements that
leave the vacuum state invariant the little group, and say that the symmetry G
is spontaneously broken down to H 15 .
The Lie algebra of the little group is made of a subset of generators fxg of the
generators fXag of G. Since
e??iwaxa0 = 0 (2.82)
for arbitrary wa, all the generators of the little group must hold the equation
x0 = 0 (2.83)
15 For an example take G = SU(2),  = (1; 2; 3) and V () = (21
+ 22
+ 23
?? a2)2
We can see the vacuum solution 0 = (01; 02; 03) with 2
01 + 2
02 + 2
03 = a2. If we x
a solution 0 pointing in the direction e1, it follows that a U0 = 0 for a rotation U with
axis e1. Since we can write every such U in the Form U = exp(??iwX1) we see that SU(2) is
spontaneously broken down to U(1).70 Topology in Physics
Since the generators of G not in the set fxg cannot annihilate 0 we can divide
the set fXag into two disjoint subsets
fXag = fXj ; xg ; Xj0 6= 0 (j = 1; ;K) (2.84)
x0 = 0 ( = 1; ;N ?? K)
For convenience, we choose real antisymmetric generators fTjg instead of the
hermitian fXjg,
Tj = ??iXj (j = 1; ;K) and (2.85)
t = ??ix ( = 1; ;N ?? K);
and we assume 0 to be a real vector and therefore the representational vector
space to be a real R-dimensional vector space.
We can show that the vectors Tj0, (j = 1; ;K) are independent and therefore
span a K-dimensional subspace of the R-dimensional representational vector
space. For the little group to be non-empty, we need to satisfy the condition
R ?? K  0 (2.86)
We call the K-dimensional space spanned by Tj0 (j = 1; ;K) the Goldstone
space and its complement the (R ?? K)-dimensional space, the Higgs space.
It can be shown that for any vector  in the representational vector space and
for any gauge group G, there is always a gauge transformation U0 2 G such that
U0 is orthogonal to the Goldstone space
(Tj0;U0) = 0 ; (j = 1; ;K); (2.87)
where we use the standard scalar product (f; g) =
PR
n=1 fngn. This U0 is said
to be in unitary gauge 16. Therefore we have
(x) ! U0(x)(x)
16 Proof
For xed  and , consider the mapping
f  G ! R
f  U 7! (;U)
Since G is compact, the function f has an extrema, let's say at position U0. A small variation
of U around U0 therefore gives
f = f(U0 + U) ?? f(U0) = 0
By writing the element U = !aTaU0 and using the denition of f, we see
0 = f = (; !aTaU0) = !a(; TaU0) = !a(Ta;U0)
Since the !a are arbitrary, the last scalar product has to be zero and therefore the statement
follows.Goldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 71

Conclusions
So far we have done a lot of very theoretical work that is schematically shown
in Fig. 2.7. In the upper part, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a global
symmetry is considered. We have seen, that for those generators of the global
symmetry group that do not leave the vacuum state invariant exist corresponding
Goldstone bosons (Goldstone's thm). For the other generators that leave the
vacuum state invariant, we get the same massive particles as in the case of no
spontaneous symmetry breaking.
In the lower part of Fig. 2.7, we consider the case of spontaneous symmetry
breaking of a local symmetry. As we have seen in the discussion of the Higgs
mechanism, the Goldstone bosons associated to the K generators of the gauge
group that do not leave the vacuum state invariant are only gauge phantoms
, which means that they can be gauged away. Doing so, the same number of
massless gauge bosons as the number of Goldstone bosons get massive. Considering
the generators that leave the vacuum state invariant, as in the case of
global symmetry breaking, they imply their Higgs bosons corresponding to them.
When we have no Goldstone bosons to gauge away, the corresponding massless
gauge bosons stay massless.
Until now, we have ignored the experimental results in our discussion about
what kind of particles we have been able to detect. If we want to reduce all
possible theories to those that contain only the particles already measured, we
may not have any massless particles except one, the photon. To achieve this, the
entire gauge group must be spontaneously broken, except for a one parameter
subgroup. The gauge eld corresponding to it remains then massless and we consider
it to be corresponding with the electromagnetic potential that does indeed
contain a massless particle, the photon.
It might be useful to remember historically that the spontaneous symmetryGoldstone bosons and the Higgs mechanism 73
breaking and the theory of non-Abelian gauge elds were considered to be independent.
Since both of the theories contain massless particles, the Goldstone
bosons and the massless gauge bosons, their physical relevance were thought to
be little. It took some time (1959-1967) to realize, that these two problems cancel
each other, in the way that the Goldstone bosons disappear and the massless
gauge bosons gain mass.
Two physical applications
To see that the very theoretical work we have done until now has important
applications in many experimentally proved theories, we want to have a look at
two examples where our conclusions and the mechanisms we found are successfully
used. Of course, we will discuss here only the very general results and give an
idea how our results from the previous sections get important.
Electroweak theory The weak interaction acts between all particles and is
for example responsible for the -decay of certain particles. Its range is very
small, i.e. much less than 1 fm and as the name says, it is weak compared to the
other two fundamental interactions namely the strong and the electromagnetic
interaction. The weak interaction is though stronger than the third fundamental
interaction, the long ranged gravitation. However, it is possible to formulate a
theory called electroweak theory that connects the electromagnetic and the weak
interaction, thanks to the results of the gauge theory.
Summarized, the results of the theory of the weak interaction are the following.
Three massive particles, the two bosons W and the particle Z are responsible
for the interaction and that the theory's symmetry group is SU(2). We also know
that the massless photon is responsible for the electromagnetic interaction with
its symmetry group U(1).
The idea of the electroweak theory is now to consider the symmetry group
SU(2)U(1) with the little group U(1) for a certain vacuum state that is spontaneously
broken. The existing massless gauge boson is identied as the photon
from the electromagnetic theory. The other three gauge elds get massive and
the appearing particles are identied with the three massive particles W and Z.
There also appears a massive Higgs eld.
This method is exactly like the general one we described in the previous section.
The results following from this theory do mostly agree very good with the results
from experiments, except for the missing Higgs boson that has not been found
yet.
Superconductor As a second example where the Higgs mechanism actually
takes place we want to consider the phenomenon of superconductivity. Again,
the exact mathematical formulation would take too much time to formulate here
and we focus on the general procedures.74 Topology in Physics
In the ground state of a material, under a critical temperature Tc an important
process might happen the condensation of the electrons to electron pairs
called cooper pairs. This happens because of a small electron-electron attraction.
The fermion property of one electron has disappeared because the cooper-pairs
can be treated as spinless particles. Such a procedure does force the question if
a symmetry of the system might be broken. To check that, we need some more
mathematical formalism, which we can nd in the Landau-Ginzburg theory of
superconductivity.
The idea of the Landau-Ginzburg theory of superconductivity is to couple the
Landau description of a (second order) phase transition to an external electromagnetic
eld. The Lagrangian of this theory is quite similar to the one we used
in the section 2 where we discussed an example of the Abelian Higgs mechanism,
L(x) = ??
1
4
FF + (D)D ?? ( ?? 20
)2 (2.99)
where the 20
is proportional to the term (T ?? Tc)=Tc. This Lagrangian is valid
only for temperatures below the critical temperature Tc because only boson and
no fermion elds appear. We also know already that this Lagrangian is invariant
under the local U(1) gauge transformation (see equation (2.1) and (2.8)) and
that the vacuum state is spontaneously broken. One result we can use now is
that the formerly massless gauge particle has got the mass m2
A = 2e220
. Since
we consider the gauge eld A as corresponding to the vector potential from
electrodynamics and the former massless particle to the photon, we see that the
latter gets massive with the mass mA. From the theory of electrodynamics we
know that a mass term for the elds appearing in the Lagrangian leads to the
Proca Lagrange density. This generates elds that vanish within the scale of 1
mA
.
This explains the Meissner eect that says that an external electromagnetic eld
penetrates a superconductor only to the depth 1
mA
.3 Magnetic monopoles Dirac
and Polyakov-t'Hooft
Philip Grech
Supervisor Urs Wenger
Although not yet found in nature magnetic monopoles are of
theoretical interest. In particular their existence would yield an
explanation for the quantisation of electric charge.
We will consider two dierent constructions The rst one was
given by Dirac in 1931, who examined the consequences of a magnetic
monopole if a consistent description in electrodynamics and
quantum mechanics is required. We will use two approaches The
rst one is based on the quantisation of the angular momentum
in quantum mechanics, whereas the second uses gauge transformations
of the electromagnetic eld.
The second construction will follow 't Hooft and Polyakov, who
were able to show that magnetic monopole solutions can also
arise in non-Abelian gauge theories. We will not quantise the
elds. Furthermore, we try to illuminate the connection between
the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole and the Dirac monopole.
A lower bound on the monopole mass will be calculated and
we see that under rather special assumptions the eld equations
for the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole can be solved analytically.
The so obtained solution will dier from the Dirac monopole
fundamentally.

Covariant Formulation of Electrodynamics
We will not deduce the fact that a covariant formulation of electrodynamics can
be given, yet just repeat the principal results (for further information see [10] or

scalar (Given that (j) is a four-vector it follows from (3.3) that (A) is a fourvector).

the duality transformations ~E ! ~B and ~B ! ??~E.

function. Then we have
(F0) = (@A ?? @@ ?? @A + @@) = (F)Magnetic monopoles Dirac and Polyakov-t'Hooft 77
Thus the electromagnetic eld remains unchanged.
This formalism will be used to be able to illustrate certain parallels between
the Abelian and the non-Abelian case. In this chapter we shall content ourselves
with the usual Maxwell equations, since the covariant formulation is not really
needed for the arguments given.

It is easy to verify that also the other equations are invariant under the above
transformation. Assume that m
e
is equal for every particle in nature. Then there
is an  2 R such that
0
m = e(sin  +

e
cos ) = 0
and
~ j0m = 0
accordingly.
It is thus a convention when we choose qe = ??jej and qm = 0 for an electron.
Therefore the crucial question is not whether non-vanishing magnetic charge densities
exist but whether there are two particles with dierent ratios qm
qe
. We remark
that when we talk about magnetic monopoles in this article, we always think of
a particle which has a dierent ratio qm
qe
than what has been measured yet.
19Alternatively we could have written @F = j and @  F = k with (k) = (m;~jm).78 Topology in Physics
Angular Momentum Approach
For the further discussion of the Dirac Monopole we refer to [12] and [13]. Dirac
discovered a quantisation condition for the electric charge by requiring a consistent
description of magnetic monopoles in electrodynamics and quantum mechanics.
In this chapter we show how we can connect the magnetic charge to
a certain angular momentum. The quantisation of the electric charge will then
follow directly from the quantum mechanical quantisation of this angular momentum.
Consider a particle at the point ~r with electric charge q and mass m in the eld

we see that the trajectory of the particle lies on a cone around the negative ~ Jaxis
with semi-vertical angle arccos( qg
4J ) and its apex at the monopole. The rst
equation in (3.17) will lead us to our goal If we involve quantum mechanics it
is reasonable to expect that the components of ~ J will satisfy the commutation
relations of the angular momentum algebra (see also chapter (1)) and have thus
eigenvalues being integer multiples of 1

which is the Dirac quantisation condition. This, of course, is not a rigorous
derivation but at least it makes things plausible.
Quantisation of Charge
To see that (3.18) is equivalent to the fact that charge is quantised consider the
case of many particles with either a magnetic charge gi or an electric charge qi.

We calculate the highest common factor n0j of the fnijg and conclude that every
electric charge is thus an integral multiple of q0 = 2~
gj
n0j . By Euclid's algorithm80 Topology in Physics
(see e.g. [14]) n0j is a linear combination of the nij with integer coecients, thus
q0 is a linear combination of the qi with integer coecients. Since the total charge
of the system equals the sum of the charges of the involved particles, it is possible
to really measure q0. The same reections lead to an elementary magnetic charge
g0. Nota bene It suces a single magnetic monopole in the whole universe to
guarantee the quantisation of electric charge.
Forces
In analogy to the force law we have for electric charges, we can assume that two
magnetic charges g0 repel each other with g2

which is large even for n0 = 1. It is therefore expected to be quite dicult to pairproduce
magnetic monopoles and that they are much heavier than electrically
charged particles (we will calculate a lower bound on the mass in chapter 2).

of our system given in 1. The Lagrangian of a particle in an electromagnetic

Equation (3.30) conrms that the total angular momentum (operator) does indeed
fulll the requirements of an angular momentum algebra as we assumed in
chapter 1.82 Topology in Physics
We replace mr_i = pi ?? qAi by ??i~@i ?? qAi = ??i~Di. The operator
D = @ + ieA (3.33)
(e = q=~) is called covariant derivative. We will see that this concept can be
extended to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories. The gauge elds which form
the connection of the covariant derivative are then Lie algebra-valued.

transformation A ! A0
 = A + @. However, we can guarantee that the
equation is gauge-covariant if we specify that under a gauge transformation
! 0 = e??ie  (3.35)
In this section we have fortied the assumption that we could assume an angular
momentum algebra in section (1). Still it remains the problem that the existence
of the vector potential ~A cannot be assumed. By using the covariance of
Schrodinger's equation, we will see in the next section an approach which avoids
these diculties.
Vector Potential Approach
Construction of the Potential It is a classical theorem of vector analysis
(named after Helmholtz) that if we have a vector eld ~B with ~r  ~B = 0 then
there exists another vector eld ~A satisfying ~r ^ ~A = ~B . ~A is the so called
vector potential. Since in the case of magnetic monopoles the divergence of ~B is
non-zero at the origin, it is not possible to nd a vector potential that is dened
on every point in R3. The best we can get is a vector potential being dened
everywhere except on a line - the Dirac string S - from the origin to innity. To
be precise, we consider the magnetic eld of the monopole and attach a solenoid
along the negative z-axis, which corresponds to the Dirac string
~B
sol =
g
4r2 ^r + g(??z)(x)(y)^z (3.36)
where (x) denotes the Heaviside function. From electrostatics we know that the
rst term is the gradient of the fundamental solution for the Laplace operator.
Therefore we can easily compute
~r
 ~Bsol = 0 (3.37)Magnetic monopoles Dirac and Polyakov-t'Hooft 83
Thus by Helmholtz' theorem, ~Bsol can be represented by a vector potential ~A
such that ~Bsol = ~r ^ ~A. For the monopole eld we nd
g
4r2 ^r = ~r ^ ~A ?? g(??z)(x)(y)^z (3.38)
We will now construct the vector potential explicitly. Since the magnetic eld
is radial, only the radial part of the rotation operator is of interest
(~r ^ ~A)r =
1
r sin 
(
@
@
(sin A) ??
@A
@
) (3.39)
Thus by symmetry we can expect the vector potential to have the form ~A(~r) =
A(r; ) ^ where ^ denotes the vector (cos ; sin ; 0). Consider a sphere with center
at the origin. The magnetic ux through a circle C that intersects the sphere is
spherically symmetric and is therefore proportional to the solid angle subtended
by the circle C and the origin. This solid angle corresponds to the surface M of
the sphere cap that has been cut o by C
M = (a2 + h2) = (r2 sin2  + r2 ?? 2r2 cos  + r2 cos2 ) = (2r2 ?? 2r2 cos )
where a is the radius of C and h is the height of the cap. The magnetic ux is
gM
4r2 =
g  ((2r2 ?? 2r2 cos ))
4r2 =

Notice that for  =  the vector potential becomes singular. This is not surprising
since we are then evaluating ~A on the Dirac string.
With the so obtained vector potential it is possible to describe a quantum
mechanically behaving particle in a magnetic eld ~B . From the requirement that
for dierent choices of the Dirac string, we should be led to equivalent equations,
we can deduce Dirac's quantisation condition.
Gauge Transformation and Dirac Condition Imagining a Dirac string on

S has a singularity on the north pole of the two-sphere S2 of radius 1 with
center at the origin. For clarity, we shall denote the eld from equation (3.40) by
~A
N.
On a region where both ~AN and ~AS are well dened and generate the same
magnetic eld, they may only dier by a gauge transformation. Such a region
would be the equator E and there we have

So the more rigorous approach via the vector potential leads again to the Dirac

2 't Hooft-Polyakov Monopole
Brief Review of General Gauge Theory Formalism
We follow the introduction into the matter of gauge theory given in [15] and [12].
Consider a Lie group G with Hermitian generators fTag. L(G) is the Lie algebra
of G, the tangent space for the Lie group at the unit element. So, any C1-curve
g(t) in G can be written as
g(t) = 1 + At + O(t2) (3.45)
where 1 denotes the unity element of G and A is an element of L(G). Let D be
a representation of G and  be a Lorentz scalar eld transforming under D
 ! D(g) where g 2 G (3.46)
If g = g(x), this is a local gauge transformation. With D we can associate a
representation of the Lie algebra which { since there cannot be any confusion {
we will also denote by D
D(1 + A) = 1 + D(A) (3.47)Magnetic monopoles Dirac and Polyakov-t'Hooft 85
where  is a small parameter. It is not too hard to show that D as a function on
L(G) preserves the Lie brackets and is linear.
We introduce Lie algebra-valued gauge elds W 
a such that
W = W 
a Ta (3.48)
The usual derivative does not transform properly, since
@ ! D(g)@ + @D(g); (3.49)
and we replace it by the covariant derivative D for which we postulate that
D ! D(g)D. Such a derivative indeed exists if we specify that the gauge
elds transform according to
W ! gWg??1 +
i
e
(@g)g??1; (3.50)
because
D = @ + ieD(W)

(@g)g??1)D(g)
= D(g)@ + @D(g) + ieD(g)D(W) ?? @D(g)
= D(g)D (3.51)
Here, we used the identities D(@gg??1) = @D(g)D(g??1),
D(gWg??1) = D(g)D(W)D(g??1) and linearity of D() as a function on the Lie
algebra. We compute the commutator of the covariant derivative and see that it
is no dierential operator
[D;D]  =   
= iefD(@W) ?? D(@W) + ieD([W;W])g (3.52)
and dene the antisymmetric gauge eld tensor by
G = G 
a Ta = @W ?? @W + ie [W;W] (3.53)
so that we have
[D;D]  = ieD(G) (3.54)
This equation shows the behavior of G under a gauge transformation
G ! gGg??1 (3.55)
We conclude this chapter with some useful formulas The covariant derivative
obeys the Jacobi identity
[D; [D;D]] + [D; [D;D]] + [D; [D;D]] = 0 (3.56)86 Topology in Physics
Applying this to an arbitrary  and using equation (3.54) yields
[D; [D;D]] = ie[D;D(G)]
= ieD(DG) (3.57)
where
DG = @G + ie[W;G] (3.58)
is the covariant derivative for the adjoint representation  ! gg??1 (g 2 G),
which has this form due to equation (3.55). The Jacobi identity produces the
Bianchi identity

A eld conguration satisfying equations (3.69), (3.70) and (3.71) is called
vacuum conguration. An example is
a = aa3 W 
a = 0; (3.72)
where ab denotes the Kronecker delta. A conguration satisfying equations (3.70)
and (3.71) is called Higgs vacuum conguration. The introduction of a Higgs eld
is of great importance To reach a state of nite energy, we have to ensure that
our system reaches the Higgs vacuum state. The condition V () = 0 implies that
aa = a2. Alternatively stated
 2M0 where M0 = f  V () = 0g (3.73)
M0 is a two-dimensional sphere of radius a. Since  assumes a certain value in
M0, it is not invariant under all rotations of SO(3) but only under those around
the -axis. They form a subgroup H of SO(3). Of course, for each position
of  this group is isomorphic to SO(2), or equivalently U(1), and we will call it
simply H. H is the exact symmetry group of the theory. By the introduction
of the Higgs eld  the SO(3) symmetry of our model is spontaneously broken
down to U(1).20
It is reasonable to identify H with the electromagnetic gauge group. The generator
of this group is given by the orthogonal projection of a SO(3) generator T
onto the -axis T  =a.
We will see that in the Higgs vacuum we can naturally obtain a correspondence
with Maxwell's elds. If equations (3.70) and (3.71) do not hold, fundamentally
new solutions can occur, such as magnetic monopoles.
From gauge eld theory it is known that if we expand the Lagrangian about a
vacuum conguration 0, (h(x) = 0 +(x)), the term in the Lagrangian that
is proportional (x)2 corresponds to the square of the mass divided by 2~.
20In other words Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the situation where the ground state
of the theory has less symmetries than the Lagrangian itself.88 Topology in Physics

This expression is valid in any representation. Let us quickly look at this
more closely In Maxwell's theory, the U(1) generator is essentially given by the
electric charge Q. A possible explanation for its quantisation would be that Q
actually results from a larger gauge group, say SO(3). Q is then also a generator
of SO(3) and element of the angular momentum algebra, so it has quantised
eigenvalues.
Up to now, no magnetic monopoles are involved. Yet we need a mechanism, that
tells us how to select the right directions within so(3). This is given by the Higgs
eld (which cannot vanish in the vacuum in order to provide a distinct direction
in the Lie algebra) and automatically yields magnetic monopoles. If extra elds
are added to the model, Ta may even have any eigenvalue which is half an integer.
Thus we are nally led to the condition that Q can only assume values that are
integer multiples of q0 = 1
2e~.
Monopole Solution
We are looking for simple {yet non-trivial { solutions for the model. A general
solution for equations (3.64) and (3.65) is not known. We can expect the solutionMagnetic monopoles Dirac and Polyakov-t'Hooft 89
with the lowest non-zero energy to be time-independent and highly symmetric.
Several symmetry considerations lead to the ansatz (see [12])
a(~r) = H(aer)ra=ar2 W 0
a (~r) = 0 (3.77)
W i
a (~r) = ??aij
rj
er2 [1 ?? K(aer)]  (3.78)
To obtain nite energy we have to ensure that asymptotically, (3.71) is valid
1a(~r) = lim
r!1
a(r^r) = a^ra (3.79)
Thus  denes a map from a two-sphere at spatial innity to M0, which is
essentially S2
  S2
homeo = S21
!M0
homeo = S2 (3.80)
Note that it is impossible to transform conguration (3.79) into the vacuum
conguration (3.72) in a continuous way For every   0 there is a neighborhood
U of the south pole of S21
, such that two values of  that are assumed on U
exist that would have to be mapped by two rotations with rotation axis diering
by =2. Since this dierence cannot be made arbitrarily small, the deformation is
not continuous. Therefore we can expect the monopole to be stable in the sense
that it will not fall into the vacuum state.
It exists a simpler way to obtain the equations of motion than to just plug our
ansatz into equations (3.64) and (3.65). Faddeev ([17]) and Coleman ([18]) have
found a principle which roughly states the following Suppose we have a function
(or as in our case a functional) F dened on a set X. Let G0 be the group
describing the symmetry operations of F on X. We denote the set of xed points
with respect to all symmetry operations by X0. Then the stationary points of F
over X0 are also stationary points of F over X.
It is a fact that our ansatz (3.77) and (3.78) consists of those congurations
which form the set X0, since it was obtained by symmetry considerations.
We could also argue that we are looking for those congurations which minimize
the energy ( = aer)

As  goes to zero we should be able to compensate the divergence resulting

The second term gives the condition

For the third term
K2 ?? 1 = (K ?? 1)(K + 1) ) K ?? 1 6 O() ( ! 0) (3.85)
These boundary conditions are also enough stringent for the two remaining terms.
As  goes to innity we need to ensure that the integrand vanishes fast enough

gauge particles respectively as introduced in chapter (2). Thus by this result
(i.e. by the at least exponential decay), we can consider the 't Hooft-Polyakov
monopole to have nite size, principally determined by the Compton wavelengths
~=M and ~=
Inside we have a smooth structure; outside we obtain a eld conguration
indistinguishable from that of the Dirac monopole.
Connection with Maxwell's Equations
In chapter 2 we have seen that outside a radius R0, which is determined by the
Compton wavelengths of the heavy particles in the theory, our eld is exponentially
close to the Higgs vacuum (3.70) & (3.71). This was based on an analysis92 Topology in Physics
of the eld conguration with the lowest non-zero energy.
We will now assume that any nite-energy solution will be very close to the Higgs
vacuum except for a nite number of areas, which we will regard as monopoles.
With a given , the general form of W satisfying (3.70) and (3.71) is
W =

 ^ @ +

where A is an arbitrary smooth four-vector function (see [20]). We shall content
ourselves with the following calculation, which shows that (3.96) is indeed in the
Higgs vacuum

The second term in the second line vanishes due to the Leibniz rule

This result is derived in the appendix. The eld tensor points in the direction

with the U(1) gauge group of rotations about , which we can identify with the
electromagnetic eld strength tensor.

Since the modulus of  is nite, this equation only holds if @F = 0. Analogously,
we can transform the Bianchi identity D G = 0 into the homogeneous
Maxwell equations @ F. So outside the monopole our SO(3) theory coincides
with Maxwell's U(1) theory.Magnetic monopoles Dirac and Polyakov-t'Hooft 93
Generalised Quantisation Condition for the 't Hooft-Polyakov Monopole
We proceed with our analysis of a eld in the Higgs vacuum by regarding the
magnetic ux, g, through a surface . Since outside the monopole the elds obey
Maxwell's equations, it is only possible to receive a non-zero ux by integrating
over a surface that surrounds a region where (3.70) and (3.71) are not satised,
namely around a monopole region

The last term in equation (3.98) vanishes due to Stokes' theorem (@S = ;). If 
has the shape of a sphere (as we had it before take e.g. S21
) we see immediately
that the derivatives @i are tangential to S2
a. Thus the magnetic charge only
depends on the values that  assumes on .
Furthermore consider a variation of the eld
 +     = 0 (3.101)
The variation of the integrand is then given by


  ( ^ @j)

(3.102)
using @i = @i and the cyclic permutations of ~a  (~b ^ ~c). As we consider
three spatial dimensions, @j ^ @k is orthogonal to  and the rst term vanishes.
Again, we can apply Stokes' theorem and the last two terms vanish when
integrated over .
Thus the magnetic ux is stable against small deformations (homotopies) of
the Higgs eld. Physically, homotopies are generated by
 time development of ,
 continuous gauge transformations of ,
 deformations of the surface  within the Higgs vacuum.
Thus g is time- and gauge-independent and does not vary under continuous
deformations of . In particular, g is an additive 'quantum number' as made
plausible in the gure 3.1

Topological Aspects
In what comes next, we will see three further approaches to characterise a smooth
map ^ between two spheres (see [21], [22] or [16]), that emerges from the map 
induced by the Higgs eld. In the end of this section we will see the implications
of these three viewpoints.
Brouwer Degree Reconsider the mapping induced by the Higgs eld ^ 
S21
! S2 and introduce also in the target space local coordinates, say 
( 2 f1; 2g), such that  = (). Fix a regular value = ( 1; 2) (i.e.
the Jacobian of ^ does not vanish at any point in ^??1( )).
The Brouwer degree of the map ^ at the point is dened as
d(^; ) =
X
2??1( )
sgn det(
@
@ ) (3.110)
It can be shown that d does not depend on the particular choice of a regular
point in S2. Thus we can write d(^; ) = d(^).
Homotopy Classes A continuous map  X ! Y , where X and Y are
topological spaces, is called a based map, if we can identify two base points x0; y096 Topology in Physics
in X and Y respectively such that (x0) = y0. Two based maps 0 and 1 are
called homotopic if and only if there is a continuous map
~  X  [0; 1] ! Y (3.111)
with a parameter  2 [0; 1], such that ~ j=0 = 0 and ~ j=1 = 1 and ~ (x0;  ) =
y0 8 2 [0; 1]. It can be shown that homotopic denes an equivalence relation.
For the special case where X=Sn the set of homotopy classes of based maps
 Sn ! Y is denoted by n(Y ). For n  1, n forms a group, where the
group multiplication of two equivalence classes is realised as follows Consider a
representative of a class. Due to the stereographic projection such a map can be
characterised by 1  (In; @In) ! (Y; y0), where I = [0; 1] and the homotopies
1 are required to satisfy 1 (@In) = y0 8 . It can be shown that
1  2(s1; s2;    ; sn) = f
1(2s1; s2;    ; sn) s1 2 [0; 1=2]
2(2s1 ?? 1; s2;    ; sn) s1 2 [1=2; 1]
 (3.112)
does indeed dene a group operation.
An interesting result of algebraic topology is
n(Sn) = Z 8n  1 (3.113)
Thus in our case, every homotopy class is uniquely characterised by an integer
number.
Poincare-Hopf Index Let ~x0 be an isolated zero of the Higgs eld . Introduce
a small two sphere S2
 with center ~x0. The Brouwer index of the normalized
eld
~^
 S2
 ! S2 is called Poincare-Hopf index i of the zero ~x0.
Implications Now we illuminate the connections between these three denitions
Firstly, it is a special case of a general theorem of Hopf that two smooths
maps 0 and 1 are homotopic if and only if they have the same Brouwer degree.
Secondly, if  has only nondegenerate zeros, the Brouwer degree of ^ equals the
sum of the Poincare-Hopf indices of all zeros of . Thirdly, the Brouwer degree
d(^) is equal to the Kronecker index N^ .
These facts enable us to determine the magnetic charge of a eld conguration
by topological analysis of the Higgs eld.
Relation between the Dirac and the 't Hooft-Polyakov Monopole
See also [16] and [13]. It seems rather amazing that we receive the same quantisation
condition for the Dirac and for the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. There is
indeed a connection between these two.Magnetic monopoles Dirac and Polyakov-t'Hooft 97
Notwithstanding certain technical assumptions, we can write MH = G=H
where MH is the vacuum manifold, G the original gauge group and H the gauge
group after symmetry breaking. Thus the magnetic charge can by the previous
chapter be characterised by 2(G=H).
Furthermore, in the case of the Dirac monopole, the gauge transformations
e??ie() between the gauge elds on the two hemispheres of S2 (see chapter (1))
are paths in U(1) = S1 and can be classied by 1(U(1)) = 1(S1) = 1(H).
The integer n has again the meaning of a winding number in this context.
It is a remarkable result of algebraic topology that
2(G=H) = 1(H); (3.114)
or in our special case
2(SO(3)=U(1)) = 2(S2) = 1(S1) (3.115)
This corresponds with equation (3.113) and yields a link between the Dirac and
the 't Hooft-Polyakov point of view.
To be more concrete, let us try to gauge ^ such that it points in the direction
of T3. Of course, if ^ has a non-vanishing winding number, we cannot transform
it smoothly into the constant map. However, this can be done on the northern
(we denote the group element of the associated gauge transformation by g(1)) and
southern hemisphere (g(2)) of S2 respectively. On the overlap region (=equator),
g(1)g(2)??1
preserves ^0 = T3 and therefore lies in the U(1) subgroup of SU(2)
generated by T3 g(1)g(2)??1
= exp(i()T3).
The gauge transformations g(1) and g(2) are well dened on their respective
regions (2) = (0) + 2 ~N ; ~N 2 Z. Consider now the two abelianised gauge
elds that we get after the transformation (which, for the Higgs eld, looks as
follows ^(1) = D(g(1)g(2)??1
)^(2) = g(1)g(2)??1^(2))
A(1) ?? A(2) = ??

~r
 (3.116)
Since the Higgs eld is now constant, equation (3.98) exactly simplies to
the case of the Dirac monopole the total magnetic ux is determined in the
same way and does only depend on the amount by which  increases around the
equator. One can show that ~N = N.
Bogomolny Bound on the Monopole Mass
In the remaining part of this article we refer to [12]. Contrary to the Dirac
monopole, which we have to regard as an external source and for which it is
therefore impossible to calculate the mass, we can give an estimate for the lower
bound on the mass of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole.98 Topology in Physics
From dierential geometry we have the following formula holding for covariant
derivatives
X  hY;Zi = hDXY;Zi + hY;DXZi
where the connection of D is compatible with h ; i and X,Y,Z denote smooth
vector elds. Thus (without proving the compatibility of D with h ; i), it follows
that

simplies to E = M and we get

where the non-trivial step is the third equality. The estimate holds for any  2 R
and we can interpret the last line as the standard scalar product of the vector
~ = (aq; ag) and the unit vector ~e = (cos ; sin ). Since  is arbitrary, we choose
~e parallel to ~. The last line then equals the norm of ~ and we get the most
stringent inequality, the Bogomolny bound on the monopole mass

it impossible to observe magnetic monopoles with contemporary technologies.
Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommereld (BPS-) Monopole
In this chapter we will see that for the special case of a vanishing potential
V () analytic solutions of our problem exist, which saturate the bound (3.122).
Thus the inequalities in the Bogomolny estimate have to become equalities. This
implies the following conditions (q=0)
D0 = 0 E i
a = 0 (3.124)
B i
a = (Di)a as g 
 0 (3.125)
V () = 0 (3.126)
These equations can only be simultaneously realised in the limit  ! 0+ for
the proportionality constant of the potential V .
Although V vanishes ultimately, we will keep the boundary condition
jj ! a as r ! 1 (3.127)
such that the charges are still dened and quantised. The equations of motion
now take the form
DG = e ^ D DD = 0 (3.128)
Equation (3.125) is called the Bogomolny equation and is a rst order dierential
equation. While the equations of motion give a condition for stationary points
of the energy, the Bogomolny equation yields a global minimum of the energy
for a given N. With a straightforward computation, it can be shown that such a
minimum is indeed a stationary point.
Using our ansatz (3.77) & (3.78) we get

By dierentiating the one and substituting it into the other equation we would
get the original equations (3.82) and (3.83). The change of variables H = ??1??h
and K = k yields the equations (' denotes the derivative)
k0 = hk and h0 = k2 (3.130)
This system can be decoupled
h00 = 2kk0 = 2hk2 = 2hh0 = (h2)0 ) h0 = h2 + A; A 2 R (3.131)
The boundary conditions (3.85)-(3.86) yield that h ! ??1 and h0 ! 0. This
leads {by substitution in the dierential equation{ to A = ??1. So we can integrate
equation (3.131)
 + B = ??
Z

B has to be zero since this is the only value for which H = ??h??a is continuous
(only then the divergence of coth( + B) at  = ??B can be compensated) and k
is now easily obtained
k = 

H() =  coth  ?? 1 (3.134)

The massless Higgs eld is now long range because as r ! 1

(3.136)
With long range we mean that in addition to the previously derived exponential
decay we have a much slower algebraic decay. Due to the Bogomolny equation
the contribution of the gauge and the Higgs eld to the mass density are equal.
This results in a twice as big density in the tail of the monopole as we had it in
the constructions by 't Hooft-Polyakov (for   0) or Dirac. This should yield
observable consequences if we analyse interactions with a gravitational eld.
Furthermore, the long range force exerted by the Higgs eld is always attractive
and has been found to be equal in magnitude (see [23]) to the magnetic forceMagnetic monopoles Dirac and Polyakov-t'Hooft 101
law induced by equation (3.12) Oppositely charged monopoles experience an
enforcement of the attraction but in the case of equally charged monopoles the
two forces exactly cancel. We conclude with the remark that the BPS-monopole
shows that the 't Hooft-Polyakov construction can dier essentially from the one
given by Dirac and that it is therefore more general.102 Topology in Physics
