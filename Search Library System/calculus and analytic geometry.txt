CHAPTER I
Rectangular Coordinates
The material of this chapter has the twofold purpose of sharpening algebraic
manipulation and laying a foundation of analytic geometry, on which calculus calls
heavily for illustration and interpretation. Work with inequalities reviews the
algebraic laws hidden behind such terms as "transpose" and "cross multiply," but
inequalities are indispensable for basic understanding of limits. The beginning of
set theory is given even though the amount included is now taught in many high
schools. Set theory is a relatively new discipline in elementary mathematics, but its
clarifying and unifying features assure it a prominent and lasting place. The notions
and notations of set theory reappear throughout the book wherever it is advantageous
to use them.
At the risk of seeming to de-emphasize other topics, we recommend that the
definition of a function and functional notation (Sec. 8) be given especially careful
study. Also, the axiom stated in Sec. 4 might seem to have little importance as it
appears here, but this axiom will be used repeatedly.
1. Inequalities and Absolute Values
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the
numbers is zero. Thus
(1) (x + 2)(3x - 5) = 0
if x = -2 or else x = and there is no other number satisfying (1).
Only real numbers will be considered in this book, and the properties of
real numbers sufficient for arithmetic and algebra involving equations will be
assumed. Some work on inequalities will now be given.
To state that x represents a negative number, we write x < 0 or 0 > x.
Hence, 1 /x < 0 if and only if x < 0. Also y > 0 or 0 < y means that y
represents a positive number.
DEFINITION. The symbolism s < t will be used if and only if s and t represent
numbers such that s - t < 0. Alternatively t > s if and only if t - s > 0.
The symbol "<" is read "less than" and ">" is read "greater than".
THEOREM 1.1 . Let x, y, and a represent numbers.
1. Then x + .a < y + a if and only if x < y.
12 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
2. ' In case a > 0, then ax < ay if and only if x < y.
3. Incasea<0, then ax >ay ifand only ifx<y.
PROOF of 3 (As an illustration of a method of proof, we shall prove only 3).
First take a < 0 and x < y. By definition, x < y means that x -'Y < 0.
Now a and x - y are both negative so their product is positive; that is,
a(x - y) > 0. Thus, ax - ay > 0 which by the alternative in the definition
means that ax > ay, as we wished to show.
For the "only if" portion of 3 above, take a < 0 and ax > ay. Then
1 /a < 0 and ay < ax. Hence, by the first part of the proof we have (1 /a)ay >
(1/a)ax. Thus, y > x so that x < y, as we wished to prove.
Notice that the above theorem gives rules for inequalities analogous to
the rules for equations referred to as "transposition" and "cross multiplication."
One must be careful, however, to reverse the sense of inequality if
and only if both sides of an inequality are multiplied by a negative number.
For example, if
Ix+3<5,
we "transpose 3 to the other side" by adding -.3 to both sides:
-1x+3-3<5-3; i.e.,-jx<2.
Now multiply both sides by
2
(notice the change of the sense of inequality)
(-z)(-*x) > (-J)2; i.e., x > -3.
The inequality (-*)x + 3 < 5 is said to have solution x > -3.
The statement "a, b, and x are numbers such that a < x and x < b" is
written a < x < b.
Example 1. Solve the inequalities
(2) 2<-i-2x<5.
Solution. Consider the two inequalities 2 < -2 2x and -2 - 2x < 5
separately. From the first of these 2x .< ,-2 .- 2 = -'z and therefore x < -4,
but from the second - 2 - 5 < 2x and therefore - < x. Thus, both inequalities
in (2) will hold if and only if x is a number such that x < -land also x.
The solution of (2) is therefore written as
- 4 < X < 4.
Example 2. Solve the inequality 3x2 + x - 10 > 0.
Solution. Sincet 3x2 + x - 10 = (3x - 5)(x + 2) the inequality may be
t The symbol is read "identically equal" and means, as used here, that both sides
have the same value for each value of x. In contrast "=" signifies a conditional equality.
For example 3x2.+ x - 10 * -(x + 2) since 3x2 + x - 10 = -(x + 2) if and only if
x is either ; or -2.Sec. 1 Inequalities and Absolute Values 3
written as (3x - 5)(x + 2) > 0. Either these two factors must both be positive or
else both must be negative so two cases are to be considered.
CASE 1. Both factors positive. Hence, consider separately
3x-5>0 and x+2>0.
From the first x > a and from the second x > -2. Thus, a number x will make
both factors positive if and only if x is such that both x > a and also x > -2.
Thus, both factors are positive if and only if x >
CASE 2. Both factors negative. Hence, consider separately
3x-5<0 and x+2<0.
In this case it must be that both x < s and x < -2. But x satisfies both of these
inequalities if and only if x < -2.
Thus, a number x will satisfy the given inequality if either x > a or else if
x < -2. The answer is: Either x a or else x < -2.
Example 3. Solve the inequality 2x2 - x - 15 < 0.
Solution. 2x2 - x - 15 - (x - 3)(2x + 5) < 0. Since the product of two
numbers is negative if and only if one is negative and the other positive, we consider
two cases as follows:
CASE 1
x-3>0 and 2x+5<0.
x>3 and x<-121
Impossible, since no number is both
greater than 3 and less than -.
CASE 2
x-3<0 and 2x+5>0.
x < 3 and x > -§ .
Both of these inequalities hold if and
only if x is such that -I < x < 3.
or
Thus, the answer is: "The given inequality holds if and only if < x < 3."
DEFINITION. The absolute value Jul of a number u is defined by
uifu>0
(3) Jul = 1-u ifit<0.
For example, 131 = 3 and 1-31 = -(-3) = 3.
THEOREM 1.2. For u any number
(4) - Jul < u < Jul.
PROOF. If u >- 0 then (top line of (3)), -Iul = -u < 0 <- ul= lul,;
but if u < 0 then (bottom line of (3)), - Jul = -(-a) = u 0 < -u = ful.
Hence in-both cases - Jul S u < Jul so that (4) is estal5lished.Sec. 1 Inequalities and Absolute Values 3
written as (3x - 5)(x + 2) > 0. Either these two factors must both be positive or
else both must be negative so two cases are to be considered.
CASE 1. Both factors positive. Hence, consider separately
3x-5>0 and x+2>0.
From the first x > a and from the second x > -2. Thus, a number x will make
both factors positive if and only if x is such that both x > a and also x > -2.
Thus, both factors are positive if and only if x >
CASE 2. Both factors negative. Hence, consider separately
3x-5<0 and x+2<0.
In this case it must be that both x < s and x < -2. But x satisfies both of these
inequalities if and only if x < -2.
Thus, a number x will satisfy the given inequality if either x > a or else if
x < -2. The answer is: Either x a or else x < -2.
Example 3. Solve the inequality 2x2 - x - 15 < 0.
Solution. 2x2 - x - 15 - (x - 3)(2x + 5) < 0. Since the product of two
numbers is negative if and only if one is negative and the other positive, we consider
two cases as follows:
CASE 1
x-3>0 and 2x+5<0.
x>3 and x<-121
Impossible, since no number is both
greater than 3 and less than -.
CASE 2
x-3<0 and 2x+5>0.
x < 3 and x > -§ .
Both of these inequalities hold if and
only if x is such that -I < x < 3.
or
Thus, the answer is: "The given inequality holds if and only if < x < 3."
DEFINITION. The absolute value Jul of a number u is defined by
uifu>0
(3) Jul = 1-u ifit<0.
For example, 131 = 3 and 1-31 = -(-3) = 3.
THEOREM 1.2. For u any number
(4) - Jul < u < Jul.
PROOF. If u >- 0 then (top line of (3)), -Iul = -u < 0 <- ul= lul,;
but if u < 0 then (bottom line of (3)), - Jul = -(-a) = u 0 < -u = ful.
Hence in-both cases - Jul S u < Jul so that (4) is estal5lished.Sec. 1 Inequalities and Absolute Values 3

3x-5>0 and x+2>0.
From the first x > a and from the second x > -2. Thus, a number x will make
both factors positive if and only if x is such that both x > a and also x > -2.
Thus, both factors are positive if and only if x >
CASE 2. Both factors negative. Hence, consider separately
3x-5<0 and x+2<0.
In this case it must be that both x < s and x < -2. But x satisfies both of these
inequalities if and only if x < -2.
Thus, a number x will satisfy the given inequality if either x > a or else if
x < -2. The answer is: Either x a or else x < -2.
Example 3. Solve the inequality 2x2 - x - 15 < 0.
Solution. 2x2 - x - 15 - (x - 3)(2x + 5) < 0. Since the product of two

x < 3 and x > -§ .
Both of these inequalities hold if and

or
Thus, the answer is: "The given inequality holds if and only if < x < 3."
DEFINITION. The absolute value Jul of a number u is defined by

(3) Jul = 1-u ifit<0.
For example, 131 = 3 and 1-31 = -(-3) = 3.
THEOREM 1.2. For u any number
(4) - Jul < u < Jul.
PROOF. If u >- 0 then (top line of (3)), -Iul = -u < 0 <- ul= lul,;
but if u < 0 then (bottom line of (3)), - Jul = -(-a) = u 0 < -u = ful.
Hence in-both cases - Jul S u < Jul so that (4) is estal5lished.Sec. 2 Linear Coordinate System 5
It should be seen that a point x1 precedes a point x2 if and only if the
numbers x1 and x2 are such that x1 < x2. Also, with x1 and x2 numbers such
that x1 < x2, the distance between the point x1 and the point x2 is (x2 - x1)
units; that is:
To find the distance between two points on the line subtract the lesser
coordinate from the greater coordinate.
For example, the distance between the point 2 and the point -3 is 2 - (-3)
= 5 units.
Since x2 - x1 = -(x1 - x2) it follows that:
The distance between a point x1 and a point x2 is jx2 - x1j units.
Example. With a and b numbers such that a < b, find the coordinate of the
point which is two-fifths of the way from the point a to the point b.
Solution. The length of the interval with end points a and b is b - a units. Thus,
from point a proceed toward b the distance 5(b - a) units and reach the point whose
coordinate is
2 3a + 2b
5
As a different problem notice that the point two-fifths of the way from point b
to point a has coordinate
b-5(b-a)= 2a + 3b

3. Intervals, Half-lines, and Linear Motion
Let a and b be numbers such that a < b and consider the point a and
the-point b.
The sett of all points actually between point a and point b is called the
a, b open interval with end points a and b. This open
closed interval is represented by I(a,b). Thus, a point x lies
a b on I(a,b) if and only if the number x is such that
open a < x < b.
Figure 3.1 The set of all points whose coordinates satisfy
a < x is called the open half-line with lower end
point a and is represented by I(a, oo). The open half-line with upper end
point b is represented by I(- oo,b) and is the collection of all points- whose
coordinates satisfy x < b.
If a < b, notice that the set common to both I(a, oo) and I(- oo,b) is
t The word "collection" may be used instead of "set."Sec. 3 Intervals, Half-lines, and Linear Motion 7
I(a,b), since a point x* belongs to both of these half-lines if and only if
a<x<b.
The set of all points x such that a < x < b is said to be a closed interval
and is represented by I[a, b]. Thus a closed interval includes both of its end
points and all points between them.
An interval I[a, b) which includes its lower end point, but not its upper
end point, is said to be closed on the left and open on
the right. In a similar way an interval I(a, b], open on
the left and closed on the right, is defined. a b
The intervals I(a,b), I[a,b], I[a,b), and I(a,b] all have Figure 3.2
the same end points and thus the same length; namely,
b - a units. For each of these intervals the mid-point has coordinate
(1)
a + b
2
For the distance between the mid-point and either end of any of these intervals
is (b - a)12 units, and thus the coordinate of the mid-point may be obtained
either as
a-l 1(b-a)=a+b or as b-1(b-a)=a+b.

Many problems are concerned with, or may be interpreted as, the motion
of a particle on a line. Say, for example, that a particle moves on a line
according to the law
(2) s= t2-5t+3, 0 <t 510.
This means that some instant (probably the beginning of an experiment)
has been selected as zero time, and for the next 10 units of time (seconds,
minutes, months) a particle moves on the line in such a way that t time units
after zero time, the position of the particle on the line is obtained by squaring
t, subtracting 5 times t, and adding '3. Presumably, the experiment stops
when t = 10 or some other law applies from then on. Thus
s=02-5(0)+3=3 when t=0,
s=12-5(1)+3=-1 when t=1,
s=22-5(2)+3=-3 when t=2,
s=32-5(3)+3=-3 when t=3,
s=42-5(4)-3=-1 when t=4,
etc., up to s = 102 - 5(10) + 3 = 53 when t = 10.
One way of visualizing the motion of the particle is to mark its position on
the coordinate system at several different times, as in Fig. 3.3. This motion
is illustrated more realistically by Fig. 3.4. The location of the exact place8 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
at which the particle changes direction and the determination of the velocity
of the particle at any designated times are problems of calculus that are

considered later. Assuming that a particle is moving on a line according to
a law which gives the coordinate s of the particle at each time t in a certain
range, we give the following definition.
DEFINITION. The average velocity of the particle from time t1 to time t2 is
defined to be
(s at t2) - (s at t1) (linear units)l(time unit).
t2 - t1
For the particle moving according to the law (2),
when t1 = 1, then s = 12 - 5(1) + 3 -1,
when t2 = 1.1, then s = (1.1)2 - 5(1.1) + 3 = -1.29
and then during the time interval from t1 = 1 to t2 = 1.1 the average velocity
is
-1.29 - (-1) = -0.29 =-
1.1 - 1 0.1
2.9 (linear units)/(time unit).
The minus sign in -2.9 means that at time t2 = 1.1 the position of the
particle precedes its position at time t1 = 1.

b. s=t+t,t>0. d. s=3t-1/t2+1. f. s=10/Vt2+1.
4. Sets of Numbers and Sets of Points
A set A and a set B are said to be equal, and A = B is written, if each
element of A is also an element of B and each element of B is also an element
of A; that is, if and only if A and B are merely different names for the same
set. A B means there is at least one element in one of the sets which is
not in the other.
It has become quite standard to use
(1) {x I statement about x}
to mean, "The set of all entities which when substituted for x makes the
statement true." Also (1) is read, "The set of all x for which the statement
about x is true." Thus, the set R defined by
(2) R = {x I x is a rational number}
is "The set of all rational numbers" and hence R contains all those numbers
and only those numbers which can be written as the ratio of two integers.10 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
The set
(3) S = {x I x < 0, or else both x > 0 and x2 < 2}
consists of all negative numbers and zero together with all those positive
numbers whose squares are less than 2. For example, -1, -2.5, -200 are
in S and also 1, 1.4, 1.41, and 1.414 are in S.
Notice that the sets
(4) T={xl-1<x<3} and T'={xI-1<xS3}
both have a smallest number, T has no largest number, but 3 is the largest
number in V.
A set A of numbers is said to be bounded above if there is a number b
such that whenever x is in A, then x < b. Such a number b is said to be an
upper bound of A. Hence, if b is an upper bound of A, then any number
greater than b is also an upper bound of A. Similar definitions may be made
for bounded below and lower bound.
Considering the sets R, S, T, and T' defined above; R is neither bounded
above nor bounded below; S is bounded above, for example, by 2 and also
by 1.415; T and T' are both bounded above and 3 is the smallest upper
bound of both T and V.
A statement about x need not be true of any number x. For example,
"x < 1 and x > 2" does not hold for any number x. Thus,
E = {xIx<1andx>2}
is the empty set. The phrase "C is a non-empty set of numbers" means that
the statement which defines C is true for at least one number.
In addition to the usual properties of numbers (which are either stated as
axioms or taken as intuitive), we state the following axiom.
1L AXIOM. If A is a set of numbers which is non-empty and bounded above and if
B = {x I x is an upper bound of A},
then in B there is a smallest number; that is, every non-empty set of numbers
which is bounded above has a smallest upper bound. Also, every non-empty set
of numbers which is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.
Knowing that 1/2 means the positive number whose square is 2, we see
that is not in the set S defined in (3), but that 1/2 is the least upper bound
of this set S.
Any set A of numbers may be visualized as a set of points on a line by
putting a point in the point set if and only if the coordinate of the point is a
number in A.Sec. 4 Sets of Numbers and Sets of Points 11
Given two sets A and B, then the union of these sets is defined to be the
set consisting of all those elements which belong either to A or to B or to
both. The union of sets A and B is denoted by
(5) A U B.
For example, if A is the set of points on the closed interval joining -1
to 1, and if B is the set of points of the closed interval from 0 to 2; that is, if
(6) A = I[-1,1] and B = I[0,2],
then the union A U B is the set of points of the closed interval from -1 to 2:
A U B = I[-1,2].
The intersection of two sets A and B is defined to be the set consisting of
all elements which belong both to A and to B. The intersection of sets
A and B is denoted by.
(7) A n B.
Thus, for the particular sets A and B given in (6),
A n B = I[0,1],
since a number x belongs to both of these sets if and only if x satisfies
OSxSl.
Notice that an element belongs to A U B if and only if this element
belongs to A or to B, or to both, but belongs to A r) B if and only if it belongs
to A and to B. Thus, in the definition of union the key word is "or," but for
the intersection the key word is "and."
If two sets A and B have no common elements at all, then a convenient
descriptive expression is, "The intersection of these sets is empty."
Thus, givenA={xl-1 <x<l}and B={xl2<x<3},then
A 0 B is empty.
As another example, I[-l,l) r) I[1,3] is also empty.

5. Plane Rectangular Coordinates
In a plane draw two perpendicular lines. On each of these lines take a
linear coordinate system with the point of intersection as the origin of each
system. With x a number, the point on one of
these lines that would be called "the point x"
if only one line were involved will now be called
N a "the point (x,0)." This line is called the axis of
4031 o abscissas and is usually represented as horizontal
with the point (1,0) to the right of the origin
(0,0) . The other line is called the axis of -A -
(0,1) "w
of abscissas ates, and there is an analogous correspondence
(1,0) x-axis between points of this line and pairs of numbers
(O,y), the first of which is 0.
Figure 5.1 A pair of numbers with one of them selected
as the first is called an ordered pair of numbers.
The ordered pair of numbers "x first and y second" is denoted by (x,y). For
example, the pair of numbers 2 and 3 may be used in either the ordered pair
(2,3) or the different ordered pair (3,2).Sec. 5 Plane Rectangular Coordinates 13
A one-to-one correspondence between points of the plane and ordered
pairs of numbers is established by using (x,y) to label a point if and only if
the projections of this point on the axis of
abscissas and the axis of ordinates are the
points (x,0) and (O,y), respectively. With x and (x b) _____ (0,1,)
y numbers, the point labeled by the ordered (0,1)
pair (x,y) is said to have abscissa x, ordinate y;
and together, x and y in this order are called
the coordinates of the point. (x,0) (0,0) (1,0)
The point (x,y) illustrated in Fig. 5.2 has Figure 5.2
abscissa negative, since the point (x,0) precedes
the origin on the axis of abscissas. The ordinate of this point is positive.
Example. Find the coordinates of the point which is two-thirds of the way from
the point (5,1) to the point (-2,9).
2,9) S l i Th t o ut on. e line segmen joining the points (5,1)
and (-2,9) projected into the axis of abscissas is the
interval joining the points (5,0) and (-2,0). By similar
triangles (see Fig. 5.3) the desired point has the same
abscissa as the point two-thirds of the way from the
point (5,0) to the point (-2,0), and this abscissa is
i-- +----- (5,1) 2( - 15 - 14 - 1 , 5 -3 5 - (-2))
_90) (5.0) 3 3
In a similar way, the points (5,1) and (-2,9) project onto
the points (0,1) and (0,9) of the axis of ordinates and, for
each of these pairs of points, the point two-thirds of the way from the former to
the latter has ordinate
I+3(9-1) 31.
Thus, the desired point is (J,-131 II (0,1) I
In Fig. 5.4 the regions marked I, IT, III, and TV
are called the first, second, third, and fourth quad- (1,0)
rants, respectively. To be more specific, the first
quadrant is {(x,y) I x > 0 and y > 0) with similar iii Iv
definitions, using actual inequalities, for the other
three quadrants. Figure 5.4
The axis of abscissas is also referred to as
"the x-axis" and the axis of ordinates as "the y-axis."
THEOREM 5. The line segment having end points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) has
mid point
(x1--'x2 Y1±Y2
2 ' 214 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
PROOF. The points (x1,0) and (x2,0) are the projections of the points
(x1,y1) and (x2,y2) into the axis of abscissas. The point midway between
these projections has (see (1) of Sec. 3) abscissa
x1 ± x2
2
which is therefore the abscissa of the point midway between points (x1,y1)
and (x2,y2). By projecting into the axis of ordinates the desired mid-point
is seen to have ordinate
Y1 + Y2
2
6. Slope and Equations of a Line
A line segment which is not parallel to the y-axis and has end points
(x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is said to have
slope m where
(1)
or equivalently
m = Y2 - Yl
'x2 - X1
m=Y1-Y2
x1 - x2
Notice that the difference of the
ordinates is divided by the difference
in the same order of the abscissas.
Since the line segment is not parallel
to the y-axis, the abscissas xl and
x2 are not equal, so the denominator
in (1) is not zero.
Two line segments, neither parallel to the y-axis, which have at least one
point in common, are on the same line if and only if both segments have the
same slope. As an illustration, in Fig. 6
Y2-Y1-Y1-Y2- 8-3 _ 3-8 -5
x2-x1 x1-x2 -1-2 2-(-1) 3
Thus, if any one segment on a line has slope m, then all segments of this line
have the same slope m.
A line not parallel to the y-axis is said to have slope m where m is the slope
of any line segment of the line. For lines parallel to the y-axis, the notion of
slope is not defined.Sec. 6 Slope and Equations of a Line 15
THEOREM 6.1. Let points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) be given with xl x2. Then
a point (x,y) is on the line through these points if and only if
(2) y yl = Y2 -Y i x2 - xl (x - x1)
PROOF. Since xl 0 x2 the line is not parallel to the y-axis and has slope
(Y2 - Y1)/(x2 - x1). In case x = x1 the point (x,y) is on the line if and only if
y = yl and (2) also holds; both sides being zero. In case x x1, the point
(x,y) is on the line if and only if the slope of the line segment with end points
(x,y) and (xl,yl) is the same as the slope of the line segment with end points
(xl,y1) and (x2,y2); that is, if and only if
Y-Yi_-Y2-Yl
x - x1 x2 - x1
and this equation is equivalent to (2) if x x1.
COROLLARY 1. With xl, yl, and m given numbers, a point (x,y) lies on the
line through the point (xl,yl) with slope m if and only if
(3) y - Yl = m(x - x1).
For with (x2,y2) a point on the line other than the point (x1,y1), then
x2 x1, m = (y2 - yl)/(x2 - x1), and (3) follows from (2).
COROLLARY 2. With b and m given numbers, a point (x,y) lies on the line
through the point (O,b) with slope m if and only if
(4) y = mx + b.
For in (3) set x1 = 0 and yl = b to obtain y - b = mx which is equivalent
to (4).
Let a line and an equation involving x and y be given. The equation is
said to be an equation of the line if each point (x,y) whose coordinates satisfy
the equation lies on the line and the coordinates of each point on the line
satisfy the equation.
It is usual to refer to (2) as a two-point equation of a line, to (3) as a
point-slope equation of a line, and to (4) as the slope-y-intercept equation
of a line.
(5)
THEOREM 6.2. If A, B, and C are numbers with A and B not both zero, then
Ax + By + C = 0
is an equation of a line. Also, any line has an equation in the form (5).
PROOF. First let A, B, and C be given numbers with A and B not both
zero. In case B = 0, then A 0 and numbers x and y satisfy (5) if and only if16 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
x = -CIA; that is, if and only if the point (x,y) lies on the line perpendicular
to the x-axis at the point (-C/A,0). In case B 0 0, then numbers x
and y satisfy (5) if and only if
Y=--A x --C
B
that is (compare this equation with (4)), if and only if the point (x,y) is on
the line through the point (0,-C/B) with slope m = -A/B.
Next, consider any line in the plane. In case the line is parallel to the
y-axis, it cuts the x-axis at a point (a,0) and a point (x,y) lies on the line if
and only if x = a, which may be written
and this is in the form (5) with A = 1, B = 0, and C = -a. In case the line
is not parallel to the y-axis, it has a slope m and cuts the y-axis at a point
(0,b). In this case a point (x,y) lies on the line if and only if y = mx + b, and
this equation may be written as
which is in the form (5) with A = m, B = -1, and C = b.
Equation (5) is called a general equation of a line.
It should be seen that:
Two lines neither of which is parallel to the y-axis are parallel to each
other if and only if they have the same slope.
Example. Find a general equation of the line which passes through the point
(-1,5) and is parallel to the line having equation 6x + 8y - 7 = 0.
Solution. The given equation is equivalent to
y = -fix +i,
showing (from (4)) that the second line has slope m = -1. Hence, the parallel line
through the point (-1,5) also has slope m = - and (from (3)) has
y - 5 = -*(x+1)
as an equation. This equation is equivalent to
.3x + 4y - 17 = 0;
an equation of the line in general form with A = 3, B = 4, and C = -17.Sec. 6 Slope and Equations of a Line 17

7. Sets and Ordered Pairs
Chap. 1
A set is said to be well defined whenever there is a criterion which determines
whether a given entity does or does not belong to the set. Thus, the
set of all ordered pairs of numbers such that each pair has its second number
the square of its first number is a well-defined set. For example (2,4) is an
element of this set, as is (-2,4); but (3,8) is not an element of this set. We
shall use
(1) {(x>Y) I Y = x2}
to describe this particular set of ordered pairs.
This is an illustration of the standard
notation
{(x,y) I statement about x and y}
to mean, "The set of all (x,y) for which
the statement about x and y is true." By
the graph of a set A of ordered pairs of
numbers is meant the set of all those
points of the plane each of whose points
is represented by an ordered pair in A.
Thus, the set described by (1) has the
(l,o) f
Figure 7.1
curve of rig. 7.1 as its graph. A set o
ordered pairs of numbers and its graph
may be thought of interchangeably. Thus,
we may speak of "The line {(x,y) 12y = x}" meaning, of course, "The
line consisting of the set of all points each with abscissa twice its ordinate."
Also,
{(x,y) 12y > x}
is the half-plane consisting of the set of all points (see Fig. 7.2) on and above
A
Figure 7.2 Figure 7.3
the line {(x,y) 12y = x}. The line segment {(x,y) 12y = x and IxI < 2} joins
the points (-2,-1) and (2,1) as shown in Fig. 7.3.Sec. 7 Sets and Ordered Pairs 19
The letters x and y have been used in describing sets of ordered pairs, but
any two symbols whatever may be used. For example
{(s,t) 12t = s} = {(x,y) 12y = x}
since each gives the same criterion for testing whether any given ordered pair
of numbers belongs to the set.
Example. Show that {(x,y 10 <_ x < 2 and 0 < y < Jx} may also be expressed
in the form {(x,y) 0 < y < I and 2y < x < 2}.
+(0,1)
(2,1)
(2,Y)
Figure 7.4
Solution. Considering the first expression, let x be a specific number such that
0 < x < 2, and at the point (x,0) erect a vertical line segment of length x/2. The
totality of all points on such segments is the interior and edges of the triangle with
vertices (0,0), (2,0), and (2,1).
Considering the second set, let y be a specific number such that 0 < y < 1, note
the points (2y,y) and (2,y), and join these points by a line segment. The totality of
points on such segments is the same triangle and its interior as before. Thus, the
two expressions describe the same set of ordered pairs.
8. Functions
Given a point on the curve of Fig. 8.1, there may be a different point with
the same abscissa; in particular, there are three points with abscissa zero.
On the other hand, Fig. 8.2 indicates a set of points such that whatever point
Figure 8.1 Figure 8.2
is taken in the set, then no other point in the set has the same abscissa; that is,
in the corresponding set of ordered pairs of numbers no two ordered pairs
have the same first number.20 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
DEFINITION. A set of ordered pairs is said to be a function if no two
distinct ordered pairs in the set have the some first element. The set of first
elements of a function is called the domain (of definition) of the function, and
the set. of second elements is called the range of the function.
A letter or symbol may be used in referring to a function. Thus, upon
using f for a function, then f is a set of ordered pairs such that: "If (a,b) and
(a,c) are in the set, then b = c." Also, for f a function and x in the domain
off, then the ordered pair in f with first element x is denoted by (x,f (x)) and
f (x) is read fat x."
A specific example of a function is the set of ordered pairs
(-1,2), (0,3), (1,3), and (2,4).
The domain of this function consists of the set of numbers -1, 0, 1, 2, whereas
the set of numbers 2, 3, 4 constitutes the range. Upon denoting this set of
ordered pairs by g, then
g(-1) = 2, g(0) = 3, g(1) = 3, and g(2) = 4,
but g(3), for example, is not defined, nor is g(1.5).
The set (-1,2), (-1,3), (0,3), (1,4) of ordered pairs is not a function,
since two of these have the same first element, namely - 1.
Another example of a function is
f = {(s,t) jt = 3s2 - 4}.
This function has domain the set of all numbers and given any number x,
then (x,3x2 - 4) is an ordered pair in f and
f (x) = 3x2 - 4.
Thus, for this function f(2) = 8,f(2.1) = 9.23, and
f(2.1)-f(2)=9.23-8=12.3.
2.1 - 2 0.1
Hence, the points (2,8) and (2.1,9.23) are in the graph off, and the line joining
these points has slope 12.3. Also, for x a number and h 0, the points
(x,3x2 - 4) and (x + h,3(x + h)2 - 4) are on the graph of f and the line
joining these points has slope m where
m-[3(x+h)2-4]-[3x2-4]=6xh+3h2=6x-{-3h.
(x+h)-x h
Given a function (and its domain), a symbol used to represent an arbitary
element of the domain is called the independent variable, and a symbol usedSec. 8 Functions 21
to represent an arbitrary element in the range is called the dependent variable.
Thus, for a function f established by telling what its domain is and a rule for
finding f (x) whenever x is in that domain, it is customary to set
Y =AX)
and to call x the independent variable and y the dependent variable.
Moreover, a symbol used to represent an arbitrary element of a set (even
though no function is mentioned) is called a variable. A symbol which is to
be assigned one and only one value throughout a discussion is called a
constant. Upon seeing
ax+by=c,
x and y are considered to be variables and a, b, and c constants.
9. Some Special Functions
For later use we review some common functions.
A. ABSOLUTE-VALUE FUNCTION. The set of ordered
pairs
{(x,Y) I Y = Ix1}
is a function whose domain consists of all numbers, Z but whose range is the set of non-negative numbers.
The graph of this function is the two half-lines shown Figure 9.1
in Fig. 9.1.
450
The absolute-value function may be used in the
definition of other functions. For example, let
.f = {(x,y) I y =
x
+ 1"I}.
2
Figure 9.2 The graph of this function f is the negative x-axis together
with the "450 half-line" shown in Fig. 9.2.
B. SQUARE-ROOT FUNCTION. For x a non-negative number, means the
non-negative number whose square is x. Thus, ''4 = 2 and not -2. Hence,
{(x,y) I x > 0 and y =1/x}
is a function whose domain and range both consist
of the non-negative numbers. Fig. 9.3 indicates the I/ Half of v2=x
graph of this function.
It may seem unnatural, but we emphasize that
1/x2 x if x < 0, Figure 9.3
since for x < 0, then 1/x2 is positive but x is negative; so \/x2 and x cannot22 Rectangular Coordinates
be equal if x < 0. It does, however, follow that
A/ x2 = I XI
whether x is positive, negative, or zero.
Chap. 1
Notice that if Ixl < lyl, then Ixl Ixl < lxi lyl <_ lyl lyl and x2 < y2. If,
however, Ixl > lyl, then lxl > 0, lyl >- 0 and lxl lxi > lxl Iyi ? Iyl lyl so that
x2 > y2. Thus :
if x2 < y2, then Ixi <- lyi.
This fact will be used in establishing the inequality
(1) la+bl <lal+Ibl
for a and b any numbers whatever. To see this, note that ab < Jai Ibi.
2ab S 21al lbl and, by adding a2 + b2 to both sides
a2 + 2ab + b2 < Ia12 + 21al Ibl + lb12,
(a + b)2 < (Jai + Ibl)2 and hence
Ia + bl < I lal + Ibl I as noted above.
Since I lal + lbl = lal + Ibl the inequality (1) is seen to hold.
C. GREATEST-INTEGER FUNCTION. For x a number, the notation [x] is
sometimes used to mean the greatest integer less than or equal to x, or briefly
the greatest integer in x. For example,
[2.5]=2,[-2.5]=-3,[rr]=3,[-ir]=-4,-[rr]=-3.
Also,
(2,2)t- if 2 < x < 3, then [x] = 2;
'
0) -+ if 1 < x < 2, then [x] = 1; , if 0 < x < 1, then [x] = 0;
if -1 S x < 0, then [x] = -1.
(-2,,-2) Thus, the se t
Figure 9.4 1(x,y) I y = [x]}
is a function whose domain consists of all numbers but whose range consists
of all integers. The graph of this function (see Fig. 9.4) is a "stair-step" of
unit intervals which are closed on the left and open on the right. Notice,
for example, that [2] = 2 whereas 999 and if e is oy positive
number (no matter how small), then _and.{2 - e] differ by at least 1.Sec. 9 Some Special Functions 23
The set {(x,y) I y = x - [x]} is a function whose range is {y I 0 < y < 1}.
In particular among all the values of this function there is no largest value.
See Fig. 9.5.
Figure 9.5
D. SINE AND COSINE FUNCTIONS. For x a number, then sin x means "The
sine of an angle of x radians." (See page 578.) Thus,
S = {(x,y) I y = sin x}
is a function whose domain consists of all numbers and whose range is given
as {y I -1 < y < 1). This function is "the sine function." The cosine
function :
C = {(x,y) I y = cos x}
Figure 9.6
has the same domain and range as the sine function. The graphs of the sine
and cosine functions are indicated in Fig. 9.6.
As in trigonometry, for A and B numbers, then (see page 575)
sin (A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B,
sin (A - B) - sin A cos B - cos A sin B,
and sin (A + B) - sin (A - B) - 2 cos A sin B.
Hence, with b, x, and h any numbers whatever, then upon setting
b(x+h)=A+B
and bx = A - B24 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
it follows that A = bx + jbh and B = Lbh. Upon substituting these relations
for A + B, A - B, A, and B above, the result is
(2) sin b(x + h) - sin bx = 2 cos (bx + ibh) sin 1bh
which is an identity that will be used later.
E. ANOTHER SINE RELATION. Let f be the function defined by
f= ((x,y) I x 0 0 and y= sin2 1
x)
This function has {x I x 0) for domain and {y 10 5 y < 1} for range.
Since sin A = 0 if and only if A = mr
ko'ln-- for some integer n, it follows for x 0 that
11 sin21= 0

Since sin A = 1 or sin A = -1 if and
only if A = (2n + 1)2 for some integer
n, it follows for x 0 0 that
if and only if x = 2
(2n + 1)7r
Hence, above any interval of the x-axis, which includes the origin, the graph
of f (indicated in Fig. 9.7) oscillates infinitely many times.

10. Distance Formula, Circles
The distance between the origin (0,0) and the point (0,1) will now be
taken the same as the distance between the origin (0,0) and the point (1,0) and26 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
will be called the unit distance, i.e., the same unit will be used on both axes.
Figure 10.1
The distance between the points (-2,1) and
(4,9) is therefore 10 units. For (see Fig. 10.1)
the segment joining these points is the hypotenuse
of a right -triangle with sides 6 units
and 8 units long and, by the Pythagorean
Theorem, A/62 = 10 units is the length
of the hypotenuse.
With x, y, x1, and yl numbers, it follows
that:
The distance between the points (x,y) and
(x1,y1) is
(1) '/(x - x1)2 + (y - y1)2 units.
For, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2, there is a right
triangle with the segment joining the points (x,y) and (xl,yl) as hypotenuse
and sides Ix - x11 units and Iy - ylI
units long. Hence, this hypotenuse has
length Ix - x112 + Iy - yll2 units.
But Ix - x1j 2 = (x - x1)2 and Iv - V,12
, (y - yl)2, and hence the distance iy
yI
il
may be written as in (1). i
Example. Show that the triangle with
vertices (1,-2), (4,1), and (-1,3) is an
isosceles triangle. Find the area of this
triangle.
Solution. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are
V(1 - 4)2 + (-2 - 1)2 = X32 + 32 = 3V2 units,
V'(l + 1)2 + (-2 - 3)2 = V'22 + 52 = x/29 units,
V(4 + 1)2 + (1 - 3)2 = .x/52 + 22 = V29 units,
and since two of these distances are equal, the triangle is isosceles with equal sides
meeting at the point (-1,3). The altitude from this point to the side joining the
points (1,-2) and (4,1) is perpendicular to that side at its mid-point
(1 + 4 -2 + 11 = (5 ' _ 1)
Thus the altitude h is
2 2 J 2' 2
h = v'(-1 - 2)2 + (3 + J)2 = /(2E)2 + (''2)2 = z V2 units.
The base is, as computed above, 3 V'2 units long, so the area is
J(3 V-2)(12 V2) = 21- units2.
Figure 10.2Sec. 10 Distance Formula, Circles 27
With h and k numbers and r a positive number, the set of points
(2) {(x,y) I (x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = r2}
is a circle with center the point (h,k) and radius r.
For a point (x,y) is on the circle with center at the point (h,k) and radius r
if and only if v'(x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = r and, thus, if and only if (x - h)2 +
(y - k)2 = r2.
Example. Show that
{(x,y)12x2-8x+2y2+12y1}
is a circle and find the center and radius of the circle.
Solution. First write the equation in the form
2(x2 - 4x ) + 2(y2 + 6y ) = 1
where the space is left for "completing the square":
2(x2 - 4x + 22) + 2()2 + 6y + 32) = I + 2.4 + 2-9 = 27,
and this is equivalent to (x - 2)2 + (y + 3)2 = L. . Thus,
{(x,y) 12x2 - 8x + 2y2 + 12y = 1) = {(x,y) I (x - 2)2 + (y + 3)2 = 2 }
and from this second form, the set is a circle with center the point (2, -3) and radius
-Vzunits.
A set A is said to be a subset of a set B and the notation
A c B
is used if every element of A is also an element of B. For example,
{xIIx-21<J}c {xI Ix-2I<1}.
Example. Show that
{(x,y) I Ix -11 < 1 and ly - 21 < J} - {(x,y) I x2 + y2 < 9}.
Solution. The first set is all points inside
the rectangle with corners (4,3)+ (a ,a)
and (-J,.31), whereas the second set is the
interior of the circle with center at the origin
and radius 3. Geometrically, the point is
farthest from the origin and its distance to the
origin is j(4)2+ (3)2 16 + 99

11. Properties in the Large
An elementary way of plotting a graph is to obtain specific points on the
graph and then join these points by a curve. This method is essentially one of
approximation; the closer together the points on the graph are taken, the
more trust one is likely to place on the form of the graph between and near
these points. Using this method in plotting
(1) {(x,y) I x2 + y2 - 6x - 7 = 01,
the equation is first solved for y:
y=± 7+6x-x2
and then a corresponding table made:
x ...1 -31 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 81 91...
y no values 0 ±2.6 ±3.5 ±3.9 ±4 ±3.9 ±3.5 ±2.6 0 no values
Upon plotting the points (-1,0), (0,2.6), (0,-2.6),; , they seem to arrange
themselves in a circular array, but with only this to go on one could not say
with confidence that (1) is indeed a circle with center (3,0) and radius 4.
Sometimes properties in the large (i.e., overall properties) of a graph may
not be revealed even by a great many points on the graph. Some such
properties. are discussed below for graphs of sets of ordered pairs defined by
means of equations.
A. SYMMETRY. Two points are said to be symmetric to a line if the line is
the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the points. A graph is30 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. I
symmetric to a line if all points of the graph occur in pairs symmetric to the
line; the line itself is called an axis of symmetry of the graph.
If all points of a graph can be arranged in pairs so that the line segments
joining such pairs are all bisected by the same point, then the graph is said
to be symmetric to that point; the point itself is said to be a point of symmetry
of the graph.
A graph defined by means of an equation may be tested for symmetry to
the coordinate axes or the origin by noting: If an equivalentfi equation is
obtained upon replacing
(i) y by -y, then the graph is symmetric to the x-axis.
(ii) x by -x, then the graph is symmetric to the y-axis.
(iii) x by -x and y by -y, then the graph is symmetric to the origin.
For example, since x2 - xy = 1 is equivalent to (-x)2 - (-x)(-y) = 1,
but is not equivalent to either x2 - x(-y) = 1 or to (-x)2 - (-x)y = 1,
then
{(x,y)Ix2-xy=1}
is symmetric to the origin, but is not symmetric to either axis.
From the equivalence of the equation involved, it follows that:
{(x,Y) I x2y2 = x2 - 1} = {(x,Y) x2(-Y), = x2 - 1}
= {(x,Y) I (-x)2y2 = (-x)2 - 1)
= {(x,Y) (-x)2(-y)2 = (-x)2 - 1}.
Consequently, this set of points is symmetric to the x-axis, to the y-axis, and
to the origin.
B. EXTENT. The x-extent and y-extint of a graph are
{x I there is a y such that the point (x,y) is on the graph}, and
{y I there is an x such that the point (x,y) is on the graph},
respectively. Thus, a number xo is in the x-extent of a graph if and only if
the projection of the graph on the x-axis contains the point (xo,0).
For example, note that
{(x,Y) I x2y2 =x2 {(x,y) I Y = f x2 - 1}
2
Thus, if a point (xo,yo) is in this set, then one observation is that xo 0 0 but
furthermore xo - 1 - 0. Hence, for this graph the x-extent is
{x I either x > 1 or else x < -1}.
t Two equations in x and y are said to be "equivalent" if whenever an ordered pair of
numbers satisfies either equation it also satisfies the other.Sec. 11 Properties in the Large 31
This same set may also be expressed as
(x,Y) I x =
_1
.
ll Vy2
Hence, the restriction is now 1 - y2 > 0 and the y-extent is
{y-1 <y<1}.
The general procedure is to solve the equation for y in terms of x, and
then to note what restrictions on x are necessary to ensure that:
(i) No denominator is zero.
(ii) No negative number occurs under a square root sign (or any radical sign
with even index).
Next, solve for x in terms of y and note restrictions on y to ensure (i) and (ii).
C. HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ASYMPTOTE. The set
2x + 10 ((x,y) 1 Y= J x
contains the points (10,3), (100,2.1), (1000,2.01), (10000,2.001), and for e any
positive number
<2+e if x> 10 .
x x e
The fact that "(2x + 10)lx may be made to differ from 2 to within any stated
accuracy merely by choosing x sufficiently large" is denoted' by
lim2x+10-2.
X_co x
DEFINITION. For f a junction and L a number, we write
(2) lim f(x) = L
z_oo
if to each positive number e there corresponds a positive number G such that
whenever x > G, then l f(x) - LI < e.
If, however, for each e > 0 there is a number G > 0 such that
whenever x < - G, then J f(x) - LI < e
we write
lim f(x) = L.
The symbolism x -> oo is read, according to preference, "x becomes
positively infinite" or "x approaches positive infinity" or "x increases without
bound." For the specific functions we meet for some time, it will be intuitively
evident whether the limits exist as x --> oo or x - oo. For example,
lim
x2 - 1 = 1, lim Jx2 - 1 = 1, and lim Jx2 - 1 = 1

Also, there is no sense in writing lim 1 - y2 since whenever y > 1,
then 1 - y2 < 0 and VT---;2 is not a real number.
DEFINITION. Given a graph, if there is a function f and a number L such that
the graph off is a part (or all) of the given graph and if
lim f (x) = L,
X- cc
then the line {(x,y) l y = L) is said to be a horizontal asymptote in the positive
direction of the given graph. By replacing x -,- co by x - - co, the definition
of a horizontal asymptote in the negative direction is obtained.
For example, {(x,y) I x2y2 = x2 - 1) contains
x2 - 1 x2 - 1 x2 7- 1
j(x,y) I y = 2 whereas lim J = 1 and lim = 1,
`` x2 x-. cc x2 x-.-CO x2
so that the line {(x,y) I y =1} is a horizontal asymptote in both directions.
Similarly, the line {(x,y) I y = -l} is also a horizontal asymptote in both
directions.
DEFINITION. Given a graph, if there is a function g and a number L such
that the given graph contains
{(x,y) I x.= g(y)} and if lim g(y) = L,
then the line represented by {(x,y) I x = L} is said to be a vertical asymptote
(in the positive direction) of the given graph.
For example, {(x,y) x2y2 = x2 - 1} has no vertical asymptote, since
(as noted earlier) the y-extent is {y I -1 < y < 1}.
Example. Sketch {(x,y) I x2y2 = x2 - 1}.
Solution. Had we not already done so, we would now find the graph to :
1. Be symmetric to the x-axis, the y-axis, and the origin.
2. Have x-extent = {x x 1 or x < -1 }, y-extent = {y -1 < y < 1}.
3. Have lines {(x,y) I y = ±1} as horizontal asymptotes in both directions,
but no vertical asymptote.
By setting x = 1 in the equation, the point (1,0) is the point on the graph with
smallest positive abscissa. With this information, we can hardly fail to sketch fairlySec. 11 Properties in the Large 33

are easily drawn, and then from these
two the desired set (1) may be obtained
by so-called "Geometric Addition" as
shown in Fig. 11.2. For example, the
point P of the desired graph was obtained

P such that PQ = RS with P below Q
since S is below the x-axis.

E. OBLIQUE ASYMPTOTES. A graph may have asymptotes which are
neither horizontal nor vertical.
DEFINITION. Let a graph be defined by means of an equation. If there are
numbers m and c and a function f such that the given graph contains (or is)
(2) {(x,y) I y = mx + c + f (x)} and if lim f (x) = 0,
x-CO
then the line {(x,y) I y = mx + c} is said to be an asymptote in the positive
direction. A similar definition may be given for an asymptote in the negative
direction.
For example, {(x,y) I x2 - 2xy + 2x - 1 = 0} is also
{(x,Y)IY=2x+1-
and, hence, the line {(x,y) I y = jx + 1} is an asymptote. The graph may be
drawn by using geometric addition.

as we please (and the absolute value of the fraction as small as we please)
merely by choosing x sufficiently large. Consequently lim f (x) = 0 and,
X-CO
as defined above, the given graph has the line ((x,y) I y = bx/a} as an
asymptote in the positive direction. Since the given graph is symmetric to
both the x-axis and to the y-axis, the further asymptotic properties of the
graph hold.
In a similar way, the second set in (3) may be shown to have the same
asymptotes.
Example. Sketch {(x,y) 13x2 - 4y2 = 12}.
Solution- A. The graph is symmetric to the x-axis, to the y-axis, and, hence,
also to the origin.
. B. Since the graph is also
{(x,y)Iy='±/3x2_4} or
we have x-extent = {x I x > 2 or x <- -2}, but there
is no limitation on the y-extent.
C. There are no horizontal or vertical asymptotes.
D. Geometric addition is not readily applicable.

12. Translation of Coordinates
Let h and k be numbers, and plot the points (h,k), (h ± l,k), and (h,k + 1).
Now establish a new coordinate system with these points, respectively, as the
new origin, unit point on the new axis of abscissas, and unit point on the new
axis of ordinates. A point in the plane now has
coordinates (x,y) relative to the original axes,
but (X, Y) relative to the new axes where y
(1) X=x-h, Y=y - k: (h,k+1)4 Y
As a check, note that if X = 0 and Y = 0, then
x = h and y = k. Also, if X=1 and Y=O, (h,k) (h+1,k)
then x = h + l and y = k. (0.1)
Translation of axes may be used to simplify

Solution. In (1) substitute h = 2 and k = -2 to obtain X = x - z and
Y = y - (-2) = y + 2, so that in the equation of (2) substitute

{(x,y) 2(y + 2) = _3(x - 2)} _ {(x,y) I 6x - 4y = 17 or 6x + 4y = l}.
Two methods for determining a suitable translation are given below.
FIRST METHOD
Example 2. Determine the translation used in Example 1 to simplify the
equation in (2).
Solution. Rewrite the equation as
36(x2 - 196.x) - 16(y2 + 4y) = 127,
36(x2 - 3x + ) - 16(y2 + 4y + ) = 127
where enough space was left for "completing the square" :
36(x2 - 3x + g) - 16(y2 + 4y + 4) = 127 + 81 - 64,
36(x-2)2-16(y+2)2=144.
This equation looks simpler upon setting
X=x-2 and Y=y+2,
which are equivalent to the equations (3) used in Example 1.
SECOND METHOD
Example 3. Sketch {(x,y) I xy + 4x - y = 5} by first making a translation
of axes.
. Solution. Let h and k be numbers, as yet unspecified, and in the equation
xy + 4x - y = 5 substitute
Figure 12.3
(5) x = X + h and y= Y + k.
The resulting equation and a rearrangement are
(X+h)(Y+k) +4(X +h) -(Y+k) =5 and
(6) XY + (k + 4)X + (h - 1)Y =
5 - hk - 4h + k.
Upon selecting k -4 and h = 1, the coefficients
of X and Y are both zero, and 5 - hk - 4h + k =
5 - (1)(-4) - 4(1) + (-4) = 1 so that the equations
of (5) become
x=X+1, y=Y-4
and (6) becomes XY = 1. Thus, the new origin
X = 0, Y = 0 is at the point where x = 0 + 1 = 1
and y = 0 - 4 = --4. Hence,
{(x,y) xy +4x -y = 5} and {(X,Y) XY = 1}Sec. 12 Translation of Coordinates 39
are the same; it being understood that the first is drawn relative to the original
system and the second relative to the new system. Hence, in terms of the original
system, the graph is symmetric to the point (1, -4) and has the lines
{(x,y) y = -4} and {(x,y) I x = l}
as horizontal and vertical asymptotes.
PROBLEMS
1. Sketch each of the following after first making a translation of axes using the
given values of h and k.
a. {(x,y) 2xy - 4x + 3y = 6}, h k = 2.
b. {(x,y) I x - y2 - 6y = 14}, h = 5, k = -3.
c. {(x,y) y = 3 + 32(20)}, h = -5, k = 3.
d. {(x,y) j y = 1 + sin (2x - 5)}, h = 2.5, k = 1.
b b2 - 4ac
e. {(x,y) I y = axe + bx + c}, h = - 2a, k = - 4a
2. Use the first method to determine a translation which simplifies each of the
following, then sketch the graph.
a. {(x,y) 3x2 + 4y2 + 6x - 16y + 7 = 0).
b. {(x,y) 3x2 - 4y2 + 6x - 16y = 17}.
c. {(x,y) 4x2 + 6y2 - 12x + 36y + 63 = 0).
d. {(x,y) j 12x2 + 18y2 - 60x + 24y + 89 = 0}.
3. Transform each of the following so the resulting XY-equation will have no
X-term or Y-term. In each case give the xy-coordinates of the XY-origin.
a. {(x,y) I 2xy + 3x - 4y = -6}. c. {(x,y) I (x - 1)(y + 2) + 2x = 3}.
b. (x,) x 3x + 5y = 17). d. x 3 + x 2
13. Conic Sections
Let e be a positive number. In the plane select a point F and a line 1 not
passing through F.
DEFINITION. The point set
{P I P is a point in the plane such that the distance from --------7
P to F is e times the perpendicular distance from P to 11.
is a conic section with eccentricity e, focus F, and directrix
1. In case : F
1. e = 1 the conic is called a parabola.
2. 0 < e < I the conic is called an ellipse. Figure 13
3. 1 < e the conic is called a hyperbola.40 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
Simple expressions for sets which are the various conic sections may be
obtained by judicious choices of F and 1. Such selections of F and I are
discussed first for the parabola in Sec. 14, and then for the ellipse and
hyperbola together in Sec. 15.
14. Parabola
In this case e = 1. Letp be a number different from zero; hence, p may be
positive or negative, but p 0. Select the point (p,0) for F and select the line
{(x,y)I x = -p} for 1. The distance from a point (x,y) to F is 1/(x - p)2 + y2
units, whereas the perpendicular distance from a point (x,y) to I is Ix - (-p)I
= Ix + pl units. Since e = 1, a point (x,y) is on the parabola with focus F
and directrix I if and only if (x -- p)2 + y2 = Ix + p1. But
{(x,Y)I.\I(x-p)2+Y2= Ix+pl}
= {(x,y) (x - p)2 + y2 = (x + p)2}
= {(x,Y) x2 - 2px + p2 + y2 = x2 + 2px + p2}
= {(x,Y) YZ = 4px}.
It therefore follows that
(1) {(x,y) I y2 = 4px}, with p 0,
is the parabola with focus (p,0) and directrix the line {(x,y) I x = -P}-
Example 1. Show that {(x,y) 120x + 3y2 = 0} is a parabola. Find the focus
and directrix of this parabola.
Solution. {(x,y) 120x + 3y2 = 0} =
{(x,y) I y2 = - $°x} = {(x,y) I y2 = 4( - 3 )x}
s s x-s and this last expression is in the form (1) with p =
3 - 3. Thus, the graph is a parabola with focus
(-3,0) and directrix the line {(xy) I x = 3}. Notice
that the points (0,0), and are
on the parabola.
(-3.0) For a parabola with focus F and directrix
1, let V be the mid-point of the line segment
from F perpendicular to 1. V is equidistant
from F and I and is, therefore, on the para-
10 a a bola. The point V is called the vertex of the
parabola.
Figure 14.1 With the distance from F to I as radius,
draw a circle with center F and note the
points Pl and P2 where this circle cuts the line through F parallel to 1.Sec. 14 Parabola 41
Pl and P2 are each equidistant from F and 1, so both are on the parabola.
The line segment between Pl and P2 is called the right focal chord of the
parabola.
For the parabola (1), the vertex is (0,0) and the ends
of the right focal chord are (p,2p) and (p,-2p), so that the
I P,
length of the right focal chord is 4 pI units. Knowing the ,
general shape of a p arabola, the position of the vertex ( v
and ends of the right focal chord enable one to sketch the - ---
graph near the vertex with sufficient accuracy for most ,\ I
purposes.

Example 2. Show that {(x,y) 3y2 + 12y - 20x + 42 = 01
is a parabola and find its vertex, focus, ends of the right focal
chord, and its directrix.

Solution. Toward obtaining a suitable translation we write the equation
involved as
3(y2 + 4y ) = 20x - 42,
4 s,3) 3(y2+4y+4)=20x-42+12=20x-30

Hence, from the translation determined by
(2) X=x-2, Y=y+2,
F (is _2) we see that the graph is
{(X,Y)13Y2 = 20X} = {(X,Y)j y2 = a X} _

is a parabola with vertex (0,0), focus (O,p), ends of right focal chord (-2p,p)
and (2p,p), and directrix the line {(x,y) I y = -PIThe
line containing the vertex and focus of a parabola is called the axis
of the parabola.

point of the parabola other than P.

7. Sketch {(x,y) 10 < x < 2 and 0 < y < x2} and show that {(x,y) 10 < y < 4
and Vy _< x < 2} is the same.
15. Ellipse and Hyperbola
According to the definition (see Sec. 13) an ellipse or a hyperbola is a
conic with eccentricity e 1, e > 0. We now restrict e to be such that
e > 0, but e 1. Let a be a positive number. Thus, ae 0 ale; in fact
ae<a if 0<e<1
e
ae > a if 1 < e.
e
Select the point (ae,O) for the focus F and the line {(x,y) I x = ale} for the
directrix 1. The distance from a point (x,y) to the focus is 1/(x - ae)2 + y2
units, and the perpendicular distance from a point (x,y) to 1 is Ix - a/el units.
Thus, a point (x,y) is on the conic with focus (ae,0) and directrix the line
{(x,y) I x = ale} if and only if
V(x - ae)2 + y2 = elx - a/el.
This conic is therefore the set expressed in any of the following ways:
{(x,y) I\/(x - ae)2 + y2 = elx - a/el}
= {(x,y) (x - ae)2 + y2 = e2(x - a/e)2}
= {(x,y) x2 - 2aex + a2e2 + y2 = e2x2 - 2aex + a2}
= {(x,y) x2(1 - e2) + y2 = a 2(l - e2)}
(1) _ ((xy)
a2 + a 2(1 - e2)
1 .
With the same number e as above (e > 0, but e 1) and the same number
a > 0 as above, consider the conic with focus (-ae,0) and directrix the line
{(x,y) I x = -ale). This conic is
{(x,y) I1/(x + ae)2 + y2 = elx + afel}
which also simplifies to (1). These results may be stated as:44 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1

has the point (ae,0) and the line {(x,y) I x = a/e} as one focus and directrix,
but also has the point (-ae,0) and the line {(x,y) I x = -a/e} as another focus
and directrix.
Graphical illustrations of this statement and other pertinent facts appear
on page 47 for easy reference while working the problems.
By analogy

is a conic with foci (0,ae) and (0,-ae) and with respective directrices the lines
{(x,y) I y = a/e} and {(x,y) I y = -a/e}.
Example 1. For the sets
{(x,y) I 4x2 = 60 - 3y2} and {(x,y) I 4x2 = 60 + 3y2}
show that one is an ellipse and the other a hyperbola. In each case find the foci
and the directrices.
Solution (for the first set). This set may be written in turn as
{(x,y) I 4x2 + 3y2 = 60} _ {(xy)
x2 y2
15+20
This looks, at first glance, to be in the form (2), but if we try to set a2 = 15 and
a2(1 - e2) = 20 we obtain 15(1 - e2) = 20, 1 - e2 = 3, and e2 = -3, which is
impossible. However, from (3) upon setting a2 = 20 and a 2(l - e2) = 15 we have
20(1 - e2) = 15, (1 - e2) =J, e2 =-1, and e = 2, since e > 0. Since O <e <1
the first graph is an ellipse. Since a = 2'/5 and e = 2 (and the form (3) is applicable)
the foci and directrices are given as:
(0,''/5), (0,-'/5); {(x,y) I y = 4v'5}, and {(x,y) I y = -4V'5}.
Solution (for the second set). This set may be written as
x2 y2
(4) (x,y) 15 - 20 = 1 }
which, because of the minus sign, may not look like either (2) or (3). It is, however,
in the form (2), for upon setting a2 = 15 and a2(1 - e.2) = -20 we have 15(1 - e2)
_ -20, 1 - e2 e2 = , and thus e = V 3. Since 1 < e the graph is a hyperbola.
Since a = '/15 (and the form (2) is applicable) this hyperbola has foci and
directrices given by
(-''35,0); {(x,y) I x = 3 VI}, {(x,y) x = -3'/4).Sec. 15 Ellipse and Hyperbola 45
Also note from (4), and the previous discussion of oblique asymptotes (see Sec. 11 E,
pg. 34), this hyperbola has the lines
{(x,y) I v'3y = ±2x}
as oblique asymptotes.
The line containing the two foci of an ellipse or hyperbola is called the
principal axis of the conic, and the mid-point of the segment joining the foci is
called the center of the conic. From the typical form (2), it is seen (by substituting
y = 0 in the equation and solving for x) that an ellipse or hyperbola cuts
the principal axis in the two points (a,0) and (-a,0); these points are called
the vertices of the conic. The line segment between the vertices is called:
The major axis when the conic is an ellipse.
The transverse axis when the conic is a hyperbola.
For an ellipse (0 < e < 1 so I -e 2 > 0), it follows from (2) that an
ellipse cuts the line perpendicular to the major axis in the two points
(O,av'l - e2) and (0,-a1Vl - e2); the segment between these points is
called the minor axis of the ellipse.
A hyperbola has two asymptotes since (2) may be written as
x2 y2
a2 a2(e2 - 1) 1
where both denominators are positive since e > 1 and e2 - 1 > 0. In this
form it is seen (from Theorem 11 p. 34) that the graph has two asymptotes
given by
{(x,Y) I y = =1/e2 - lx}.
Also, the hyperbola does not cut the line perpendicular to the transverse axis
at the center; in fact from the above form
x-extent = {(x,y) I x < -a
Example 2. Find the parts defined above
for the conic
{(x,y) I 9x2 - 16y2 - 18x - 64y = 199}.
Solution. We first determine that under
the translation
X=x-1, Y=y+2
the conic is also the graph of

6_ + -9 = 1}.
(-4-2)
Figure 15
Thus, a2 = 16, a2(1 - e2) = -9,1 - e2 = - i e, and e = d. Since 1 < e the graph46 Rectangular Coordinates Chap. 1
is a hyperbola. Now ae = 5 and ale = Y. The desired information in terms of the
XY-system and then changed to the xy-system is:
X Y xy
center (0,0) (1,-2)
foci (±5,0) (6,-2), (-4,-2)
directrices {(X, Y) X = i 5g} {(x,y) I x = s or x = - 51}
vertices 4,0) (5,-2), (-3,-2)
asymptotes {(X, Y) Y = =4X} {(x,y) I 3x - 4y = 11 or 3x + 4y = -5)
Now that set notation has instilled the concept of sets and their geometric
representations, the use of set notation will be subdued. Unless
there is danger of being misunderstood, a mathematician would not write
{(x,y) 3x - 4y = 11), but only 3x - 4y = 11 and even say "The line
3x - 4}' = 11." He means, of course, "The line consisting of the set of all
points in the coordinate plane whose coordinates satisfy the equation."
We will continue to use set notation to introduce some new concepts or when
we want to be unequivocal about what is meant.

Limits and Derivatives
The most striking difference between calculus on one hand and algebra or
geometry on the other is the degree of dependence upon the notion of a limit.
Algebra and geometry are not devoid of limits (e.g., the sum of a geometric series
with common ratio in absolute value less than 1 or the area of a circle), but limits
play a minor role here; whereas, in calculus limits are basic to and permeate the
whole subject.
Calculus is traditionally divided into two main parts; one primarily concerned
with derivatives of functions (introduced in this chapter), the other with integrals
of functions (Chap. 6). This chapter, then, begins the study of calculus.
16. Limit of a Function

The function f whose graph is
represented in Fig. 16.1 is such that
f (x) is defined at least for all x satisfying
a< x< c or c< x< b and
f (c) may or may not be defined. For
x close to c the value of f (x) is close
toL; that is, given any positive number
e there is a positive number h (as illustrated
in Fig. 16.1) such that
{(x,y)I0<Ix-cl <bandy =f(x)}
{(x,y)10< Ix - cl < 6andly-LI <e}.
48Sec. 16 Limit of a Function 49
DEFINITION. Given a function f, a number c, and a number L, the function f
is said to have limit L at c:
1. If for each number S > 0- the set {x 0 < Ix - cI < b} contains
numbers in the domain off, and
2. If given any positive number c no matter how small, there is a positive
number S such that
{(x,y) 10 < Ix - cl <aandy=f(x)}
{(x,y)10<Ix-cl <6andly-LI<E};
that is, whenever 0 < Ix - cl < S, then If (x) - LI < E.
Example 1. Show that the function f has limit 2 at c = 1, where
I -x f (x) = _ , for x > 0 and x ; 1.

Solution. 1. Notice that f(l) is not defined, but f(x) is defined if 0 < x < 1

number S such that

Chap. 2
With f defined byf(x) = x we are to show that "Given an e > 0 there exists a 6
such that if 0 < Ix - cI < S then If(x) - cd < e." Merely choose 6 = e.
THEOREM 16. Let f be a function and c a number such thatf has a limit at c,
and let L be this limit. Then f has no other limit at c.
PROOF. Assume there is a second limit L1 of f at c. Then L1 L so
IL - L11 > 0 and JCL - L11 > 0. Choose e = JCL - L11 and corresponding
to this particular positive number e let 6 > 0 be such that
if 0 < I x - cl < 6, then If(x) - LI < e
and let 61 > 0 be such that
if 0<Ix-cl <61, then If(x)-L1I <e.
Let x* be such that both 0 < Ix* - cl < 6 and 0 < Ix* - cl < 61 and note
that both If (x*) - LI < e and If (x*) - L11 < e. Hence,
IL-L1I <IL-f(x*)I +If(x*)-L11 <2e=IL-L1I
which says that IL - L11 < IL - L11 and this cannot be true. The assumption,
"There is a second limit off at c" is thus incorrect, and the theorem is proved.
NOTATION AND TERMINOLOGY. Following convention, we shall write
(1) L = lim f (x)
X-'C
to mean "The limit at c of this function f exists and is L." Also, we write
lim f (x) does not exist
X-+C
to mean "For this function f and this number c there is no number L which
A
satisfies the condition 1 and 2 of the
above definition."
It is customary to read (1) as "L is
the limit of f (x) as x approaches c."
Also, a common alternative to (1) is
f (x) -* L as x -> c.
Example 2. For
f = {(x,y) I y = sin2 (1/x)} prove that
limf(x) does not exist.

Solution. LetL bean arbitrary number.
Figure 16.3 (The point (0,L) is pictured in Fig. 16.3 asSec. 16 Limit of a Function 51
if L were about 0.9.) We shall prove that this function f does not have limit L
at c = 0 by showing "There is a number e > 0 such that for 6 an arbitrary positive
number
(1) {(x,y) 0 < Ix - 01 < 6 and y = sine (I Ix))
is not a subset of
(2) {(x,y) 0 < Ix - 01 < 6 and ly - L) < E}."
No matter how small 6 > 0 is taken, the graph (1) will have points on the x-axis
and points one unit above the x-axis. Hence, for any positive number e < 2 there
are points of (1) not in (2).
17. Limit Theorem
Given two functions f and g, the sum off and g is the function defined by
f + g = {(x>Y) I Y = Ax) + g(x)}.
Hence, the domain of f + g is the intersection of the domain of f and the
domain of g. The product off and g is the function
f- g = {(x>Y) I Y= f (x)g(x)}
and the quotient function fig is defined in a similar way, but note that the
domain of fig is the intersection of the domains of f and g diminished by
those numbers x for which g(x) = 0.
THEOREM 17. Let f and g be functions whose limits at c exist:
lim f (x) = Ll and lim g(x) = L2,
X- C x-.e
and for every number S > 0 the domain of f, the domain of g, and
{x 10 < Ix - cl < b} have numbers in common. Then the limits at c of the
sum and product functions exist and

PROOF of I. Let e be an arbitrary positive number. Since it is given that f
has limit L1 at c, choose S1 > 0 corresponding to e/2 such that
if 0<Ix-cl <61, then If(x)-L11 <Ei2
and, since g has limit L2 at c, choose S2 > 0 such that
if 0 < lx - Cl < 62, then lg(x) - L21 < e/2.
Let 6 be the smaller of 61 and 62. Hence, 6 > 0 and for x a number such that
0 < Ix - cl < 6, it follows that both I f (x) - L1l < E/2 and l g(x) - L21 < E/2
so that
If (x) + g(x) - (L1 + L2)I = I (f (x) - L1) + (g(x) - L2)I
5 if (x) - L11 + Ig(x) - L21 < e/2 + e/2 = e.
Hence, corresponding to the arbitrary positive number e, the existence of a
positive number 6 has been shown such that
if 0 < Ix - cl < 6, then If(x) + g(x) - (L1 + L2)I < E.
Hence, the function f + g has limit L1 + L2 at c. In a similar way, the
function f - g has limit L1 - L2 at c.
This proof was given here to demonstrate the method of proof. Proofs of
II-V are given in Appendix Al, but the results will be used whenever convenient.
As an example, we establish the existence and obtain the value of
lim (5 + x2 ± 42). The usual procedure is to write

18. Limits of Trigonometric Functions
By inscribing and circumscribing sequences of polygons, Archimedes'
(c. 250 B.c.) "Method of Exhaustion" led him to conclude that the circumferences
c and C, and the areas k and K of circles or radii r and R are
such that
c C k K
2r 2R r2 R2
This constant ratio is denoted by IT. The method of exhaustion is the genesis
of the concept of definite integrals (Ch. 6). By means of definite integrals it
can be proved, without using the next theorem, that the areas of two sectors
of a circle are to each other as their central angles. It then follows that a
circular sector of radius r units and central angle a radians has
(1) area = a r2 units2.

(see page 578). This fact is used in proving the next theorem.

Sector OAP has area 112X= Ix. Triangle OAP has
base 1 and altitude s. Since area sector OBC <
area A OAP < area sector OAP, then

19. Composition Functions
Let f and u be functions and let F be the function
F = {(x,y) I y = f (u(x))}.
The function F is called the composition off upon u. Notice that the domain
of F is
{x I x is in the domain of u and u(x) is in the domain off}.
Thus, for x in the domain of F, then not only is x in the domain of u, but
u(x) is in the domain off and
F(x) = f (u(x)).
For example if f and u are the functions
f= {ty Iy= sin t and u={(x,t)It=xz-1}
then the composition function F off upon u is
F = {(x,y) I y = sinx(x2-i 1)} with domain {x I x ±1}.
Hence, for x in the domain of this function F, then
F(x) = 'in Xz2

Thus, a function f is continuous at c if the three questions:

2. Does lim f (x) exist?

3. Does lim f (x) =f (c)?
x-c

all have affirmative answers, but if any of the answers is "No" then f is not
continuous at c. Turn to page 83 for illustrations of "No" answers.

The definition of a limit may be combined with the above definition to
yield :
A function f is continuous at c provided c is in the domain off and in
addition, corresponding to an arbitrary positive number e there is a positive
number 6 such that
whenever Ix - cl < b, then f (x) - f (c)I < e.
For example, the function f defined by f (x) = 21x1 is continuous at c for
every number c, since for e > 0 then whenever x = c < of 2 follows that
21x1 - 21cl 1 = 2 1 1x1 - IcI I < 21x - cl < 2 2 C.
The greatest-integer function

Note that a function f is continuous at x if
(1) lim f (x + h) = f (lim (x + h)) = f (x).
h-.0 h-.0
Thus, the cosine function is continuous at x for each number x (see
Example 2 of Sec. 18) and in the same way the continuity of the sine function
may be demonstrated.
THEOREM 20.2. Given a number x and functions f and g continuous at x,
then the sum function s = f + g and the product function p = fg are continuous
at x, and provided g(x) 0 0 the quotient function q = fig is continuous at x.
PROOF. We write, checking limits and equalities in progress,
s(x) = AX) + g(x) (from the definition of the function s)
= lim f (x + h) + lim g(x + h) (since f and g are continuous at x)
h-0 h-.0
= lim [f (x + h) + g(x + h)] (by Theorem 17 I)
h-.0
= lim s(x + h) (by the definition of the function s),
h-0
which shows that the sum function is continuous at x.
In the same way (but using Theorem 17 II and 17 III, respectively) the
product and quotient functions are continuous at x, provided that g(x) 0,
for the quotient function q.
Hence, for f continuous at x, the function f2 =f f is continuous at x,
then f 3 =f2 - f is continuous at x, and for n a positive integer f n =f '2-1 f
is continuous at x.
DEFINITION. A function which is continuous at each number x in its domain
is said to be a continuous function.Sec. 20 Continuous Functions 61
Since the function {(x,y) I y = x} is continuous it follows, for n a positive
integer and for a any constant, that the function {(x,y) I y. = ax"} is
continuous. Now with ao, al, a2, , a" given numbers, the functions
{(x,y) I y = ao}, {(x,y) I y = ao + alx}, {(x,y) y = ao + alx + a2x2}, .. .
{(x,y) I y = ao + alx + ..+a"x"}
is each in turn the sum of two continuous functions; that is, any polynomial
function is a continuous function.
Let p be a positive integer, let n be any integer, and let f be the function

theorem and the other cases should be checked.
THEOREM 20.3. With p a positive integer, the function defined by (2) is
continuous at x in each of the cases:
(i) x>0andn>0.
(ii) x any number, n > 0, p odd.
(iii) x 0,n<0,podd.
THEOREM 20.4. Let xo be a number and f a function such that:
1. xo is in an open interval of the domain off,
2. f is continuous at x0, and
3. f (x0) > 0.
Then there are numbers xl and x2 such that xl < xo < x2 and such that f is
positive on the open interval I(xi,x2).
PROOF. From 1 above select Si > 0 so the interval I(xo - S1, xo + 61) is
in the domain of f. Corresponding to e = (I) f (xo), which is positive by 3
above, let 6 > 0 be a number Sdi and such that if x is any number satisfying
[x - x01 < 6 then I f (x) - f (xo)I < J f (xo); that is,
.f (xo) - ++.f (xo) <f (x) <.f (xo) + '.f (xo)62 Limits and Derivatives Chap. 2
Hence, from the left hand inequality alone, f is positive on I(x0 - S, xo. + S)
which is the domain of f since 6 < bl. By selecting xl = xo - B and
x2 = x0 + 6 we have numbers as stated by the theorem to exist.

With f a given function, let x and x + h with h = 0 be in the domain
off. Then the points

slope = f (x + h) -f(x) = f (x + h) -f(x)

DEFINITION. Let f be a function and let x be
a number in the domain off. If whenever JhJ is
sufficiently small the number x + h is also in
limy (x + h) -f(x) exists,
h---O h
then the line with the value of this limit as slope and passing through the point
(x, f (x)) is said to be tangent to the graph off at the point (x,f (x)).
Example 1. Show that the graph of y = 11x has a tangent at the point of the
graph having abscissa 2.
Solution. The point in question is (2, V2). Also, if -2 < h < 0 or 0 < h,
the point (2 + h,,,12 + h) is on the graph. Moreover, by methods used previously

Since this limit exists, the graph has a tangent at the designated point and this
tangent has slope m = 2/4.
Notice that the line tangent to the graph of Example 1 at the point (2,V)
has slope r2/4, and thus has equation
y -1/2 = (\/2/4)(x - 2).
Example 2. For the function f = {(x,y) I y = lxI} show that the graph does not
have a tangent at the origin.
Solution. Since
(x, f (x)) and (x + h, f (x + h))
(.+h,t(x+h)) are on the graph off f and the line joining these

THEOREM 21. If the graph of a. function has a tangent at a point, then the
function is continuous at the abscissa of the point.
PROOF. Let f be a function and x a number such that the tangent to the
graph exists at the point (x,. f (x)). Consequently
lim f (x + h) - f(x)
h-.o h
exists. Let m be the value of this limit. Guided by
f(x + h) = f(x + h) - f(x) + f(x) =f(x + h) -f(x) h +f(x)
we write, knowing the existence of each limit as we write it,

But the fact that lim f (x + h) = f (x) means (see (1) of Sec. 20) that f is

continuous at x, as we wished to prove,
In establishing the existence of a tangent to the graph of a function, and
obtaining the slope of the tangent when it exists, it is only necessary to
evaluate a limit of the form

Example 3. Evaluate (1) given that f (x) = x3 - 4.
Solution. For x any number,, f (x) = x3 - 4. For x and h any numbers, then
x + h is a number and f(x + h) = (x + h)3 - 4. Thus, for x any number and

the two slopes are reciprocals of each other.
22. Velocity
A car going 50 miles in 2 hours is said to average 25 mi/hr. A particle
moving along a coordinate line and having coordinate sl at time tl and
coordinate s2 at time t2, with t2 tl, is said to have
average velocity s2 - Sl = Sl - S2 (coord. units)/(time unit). t2 - tl tl - t2Sec. 22 Velocity 65
For example, if the particle has coordinate 1 when t = j and coordinate
when t = 4, then the average velocity during the time interval between t =
andt=is
2 (coord. units)/(time unit).
DEFINITION. Given a law of linear motion as a function s and given a
number tin the domain of s, then for h 0 0 and t + h in the domain of s,
s(t -4- h) - s(t)
(1) h (coord. units)/(time unit)
is the average velocity during the time interval between time t and time
t + h. Also, the limit (assumed to exist)
s(t + h) - s(t)
(2) hio h (coord, units)/(time unit)
is the instantaneous velocity at time t.
Example. Let distance be measured in feet and time in minutes and let the law of
linear motion be
s(t) = cos 77t.
For t any number and h 0 show that the average velocity between time t minutes
and time t + h minutes is
(3) - h sin u (t + 2) sin (h) ft/min
and that the velocity at time t minutes is
(4) -lr sin ITt ft/min.
Solution. The average velocity, directly from (1), is
(5)
s(t + h) - s(t) cos n(t + h) - cos in
(t + h) - t h
ft/min.
This expression may be changed by using the trigonometric identity
cos (a + fi) - cos (a - -2 sin a sin
Upon setting a + # = i(t + h) and a - # = 7rt, it follows that 20C = ur(2t + h)
and 2fl = 7rh so the right side of (5) may be replaced by (3), giving the average
velocity as

23. Derived Function

In obtaining tangents to curves and velocities in linear motions, an
essential feature is the determination of such limits as
limf (x + h) -f(x) and lim s(t + h) - s(t)
h-.o h h-.0 h
Later on it will be seen that limits of this form will have other applications.
The study of such limits without specific interpretations of the functions
involved is more inclusive than a development restricted by a physical or
geometric meaning at each step.
DEFINITION. Given a function f, the function f' defined by
(1) {(X,Y) I Y =
limf(x + h) -f(x)}
h-.o h
is called the derived function off. For x in the domain off', the number
f'(x) is called the derivative off at x, and
f'(x) = limf (x + h) -f(x)
h-.o h
In particular, if x is in the domain of f', then certainly x is in the domain
off (since f (x) must be defined), but moreover the limit in (1') must exist.
Hence, the domain off' is a subset of (and may be all of) the domain off.
Thus, for a function f, a number x is in the domain of the derived function
f' if and only if
lim f (x + h) -f(x) exists.
h-.o hSec. 23 Derived Function
Also, if x is in the domain off', then
f'(x) = limf(x + h) -f(x)
h-.o h
Example. Given that f is the function defined by
f(x) = 'fix -+3 for x >- -3,
find the derived function f'. Also, determine the domain off'.

Thus, the domain off is {x I x >- -3}, whereas the domain of the derived function
f' is {x I x > -3}.
THEOREM 23. Given a function f, if x is in the domain of the derived function
f', then f is continuous at x.
PROOF. We must show that lim f(x -+ h) = f(x) for x in the domain
off'. We write h-o

Applications of Derivatives
The derivative at x of a function f (as defined in Chapter 2 by
f '(x) = lim f (X + h) - f (X)
h-0 h
provided the limit exists) is a purely analytic notion. As already seen, however,
derivatives may be interpreted geometrically in terms of slopes of tangents to curves
or physically in terms of velocities of moving particles. In this chapter these
interpretations and others are exploited in attacking practical problems.
The innocent appearing Mean Value Theorem for Derivatives (Sec. 32) should
not be dismissed after its immediate application here; it will be the key to several
developments at strategic points later on.
28. Equations of Tangents
Given a function f and a number x, in the domain off ', then the point
(x,, f (x,)) is on the graph off, the line tangent to this graph at this point
has slope m = f'(xl) and an equation of this tangent line is
Y - f(xl) = f '(xl)(x - x,).
Example. Given f = {(x,y) I y = V2x2 + 1}, find an equation of the line
tangent to fat the point of the graph with abscissa 2.
Solution. First f(2) = 2.22 + 1 = 3 so that (2,3) is the desired point. Also
4x 2x f'(x)=DxV2+1 =2V2x2+1 '2x2+1
and, thus, m = f'(2) = 4/ J2 22 + 1 = s is the slope of the tangent line at the
point (2,3). Hence, the tangent has equation
y-3=a(x-2) or 4x - 3y + 1 = 0;
that is, {(x,y) I 4x - 3y + 1 = 0} is a straight line which is tangent at the point (2,3)
to {(x,y) l y = -+I).

the meaning of the definition for this example. Also, we may let x approach
c = 0 only through positive values (geometrically, only from the right).
The symbolism (1) is read "The limit from the right of f at c is equal
to L." In case L =f(c) the function is said to be right continuous at c. In a
similar way the limit from the left, and left continuity, are defined.
A function f is said to be continuous on a closed interval I[a,b] if f is
continuous at x for a < x < b, right continuous at a, and-left continuous at b.
THEOREM 29. Let f be a function continuous on a closed interval I[a,b].
If f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, then there is a number x* such that
a<x* <bandf(x*)=0.
PROOF in case f (a) < 0 < f (b). Let A be the set defined by
A = {x l a< x< b and f(x) < 0}.
The set A certainly contains the number a since f(a) < 0. Also, the set A
is bounded above by b. Thus (see the axiom on p. 10) the set A has a least
upper bound which we call x*. We now show that a < x* < b and f (x*) = 0.
Sincef(a) < 0 and f is right continuous at a, there is a number x > a such
that f is negative on I [a,x). Hence x < x*. In the same way there is an x such
that f is positive on I(z,b]. Hence x* < z. Thus a < x < x* < z < b so that

with xl < x* < x2 and this would mean that x* is not the least upper
bound of A, which is a contradiction. Consequently f (x*) < 0. In a similar
a a86 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
way it follows that f (x*) is not <0. Thus f (x*) = 0 which, together with
(2), is what we wished to prove.
Example. Show that 2x4 - 9x3 - x2 + 25x + 11 = 0 has a root between 3
and 4.
Solution. The function f = {(x,y) I y = 2x4 - 9x3 - x2 + 25x + 1l} is continuous
(see page 61), and hence it is sufficient to show that f (3) and f(4) have
opposite signs. To review a synthetic process, sometimes given in algebra, note that
f (x) = 2x4 - 9x3 - x2 + 25x + 11
= {[(2x - 9)x - 1]x + 25}x + 11.
Thus f(3) = {[(2 3 - 9)3 - 1]3 + 25}3 + 11. This computation may be arranged
as
2 -9 -1 25 11 I3
6 -9 -30 -15
2 -3 -10 -5 -4 so that f(3) = -4.
Similarily, to find f(4) we write
2 -9 -1 25 11 L
8 -4 -20 20
2 -1 -5 5 31 so that f(4) = 31.
The following intermediate value property will be used later.
COROLLARY. Let f be a continuous function on I [a,b] such that f (a) of (b)
and let y* be a number actually between f (a) and f (b). Then there is a number
x* such that a < x* < b and f (x*) = y*.
PROOF. Let g be the function defined by g(x) = f (x) - y*, note that g is
continuous on I [a,b] with g(a) and g(b) having opposite signs, apply Theorem
29 to obtain x* such that a < x* < b and g(x*) = 0, and finally note that
f (x*) = y,*.
In the next section it will be shown how derivatives may be used to aid in
the solution of equations.

30. Newton's Method
In this section an intuitive discussion is given of Newton's method of
starting with an approximation xl of a solution of an equation f (x) = 0 and
successively obtaining numbers . x2, x3, - - which, under appropriate
conditions, are better and better approximations of a solution.
Let f be a function whose derived function f ' exists and is not zero
wherever we wish to use it, and let f be such that {(x,y) I y = f (x)} intersects
the x-axis at a point (x0,0) so that f (xo) = 0. Ordinarily the number x0 will
not be known exactly, but by some means (such as the one of Sec. 29) an88 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
approximation x1 of xp can be found. Then the tangent to the graph at the
point (xl, f (xl)) has equation
Y - { J (xl) = f'(xl)(x - xl).
By setting y = 0 and solving for x, this tangent crosses the x-axis at the
point (x2,0) where

xn = x,3-1 - f(xn-1) for n > 2.

With a starting value x1 given, or obtained by an intelligent guess, the
numbers-x2, x3, . are called Newton iterates.

At this point in the book it is not feasible to give conditions and prove
them sufficient to insure that for each positive number e there is an integer N
such that
whenever n > N then Ix,, - xol < E.
Such questions are considered in a course on numerical analysis. An
Figure 30.2
examination of the curves of Fig. 30.1 should,
however, indicate that if a curve continues "to
bend" in the same direction on the interval
joining the points (x1,0) and (x0,0), then the
Newton iterates x2,x3, seem to approach
the solution x0.
Figure 30.2 illustrates a situation in which
x2 is not a better approximation than x1 to the
desired solution.
Example 1. Given f(x) = 2 cos x - x2 and the
starting value x1 =7T/3 as an approximation of a
root of J'(x) = 0, obtain Newton iterates until two successive iterates agree to
three significant figures.Sec. 30 Newton's Method 89
Solution. Firstf'(x) = -2(sin x + x). By using the radian column of Table 2,
we have x1 =7r/3 = 1.0472,
2(0.5000) - (1.0472)2
x2 = 1.0472 - = 1.0219
-2(0.8660 + 1.0472) ,
2(0.5217) - (1.0219)2 0.0009
x3 = 1.0219 - -2(0.8531
+ 1.0219) = 1.0219 -
3.75
Since to three significant figures x2 = x3 = 1.02, we have proceeded as far as
directed in this example. We followed the usual
practice of allowing more figures in intermediate
computations than are eventually retained.
Note: The above example stemmed from the
problem of solving the equation 2 cos x = x2.
Solutions of this equation are the same as those
of f(x) = 0, where f(x) = 2 cos x - x2. Easy
substitutions gave f(0) = 2 and f(7r/2) = 0 -
(Tr/2)2 which have opposite signs, so (by the
continuity of f) a root is between x = 0 and
x = ir/2. We could have used x1 = or/2. It is,
however, highly desirable to have a close starting
value so we sketched the graphs of
y = 2 cos x and y = x2.
These graphs (Fig. 30.3) intersected at a point
Figure 30.3
whose abscissa seemed closer to in/3 than to 7r/2, so we chose x1 = it/3.
Example 2. For A a positive number and x1 an approximation of V'A, show
that the Newton iterates for the function f defined by f (x) = x2 - A are

Let A = 3 and use x1 = 2 as an approximation of V3. Compute the above Newton
iterates for these values, continuing computation until two successive iterates agree
to three decimal places and note the agreement with /3.
Solution. Since f (X) = x2 - A, then f '(x) = 2x so that
f (x1) x2 - A 2x2 - x2 + A xz = xl - f,(xi) = xl 1 A l

By analogy the formula for x3 in terms of x2 is obtained, etc. Hence, with A = 3
and x1 = 2, these iterates (with at most three decimal places kept) are

x4 = 2 (1.7321 +
1 7321 / = 0.8661 + 0.8660 = 1.7321.90 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
Since the five decimal approximation of V3 is 1.73205, the above values for x3
and x4 are accurate approximations of 1/3 as far as they go.
In many practical problems the functions involved are not exact and an
actual solution of an equation f(x) = 0 may be no more meaningful than a
number x* such that, for example, l f'(x*)I < 5 x 10-3. If x. is a Newton
iterate, then in finding x,, the value of is computed so that at each
stage the nearness to zero of the value of the function may be seen although
the nearness of x, to a solution of f(x) = 0 may not be gauged without
further analysis, which we do not go into here.
If Fand G are functions and c is a positive number, the imprecise directive
"Solve F(x) = G(x) ± c" is sometimes used to mean "Find a number x* such
that IF(x*) - G(x*)l < c. Newton's method applied to f(x) = F(x) - G(x)
is one means of attack. It may happen, even if c is relatively small, that a
"solution" of F(x) = G(x) ± c is not a good approximation of a solution of
F(x) = G(x).
In spite of the indefiniteness shrouding the present discussion of Newton's
method, this method is useful when applied with discretion. Conditions under
which Newton iterates approximate a solution to any desired precision are
given, and proved to be sufficient, in a course on numerical analysis.

(Note: In an electronic computer the equipment for performing division is more
complicated than for multiplication. For this reason some electronic computers
do not have the necessary equipment to perform the operation B/A directly, but
the operator instructs the machine to compute 1/A by the process of this problem
and then to multiply 1/A by B.) (Hint: Setf(x) = l/x - A.)
31. Maxima and Minima
A function f is said to have maximum M if there is a number c such that
f(c) = M and f(x) < M for all x in domain f. A value f(xo) is a relativeSec. 31 Maxima and Minima 91
maximum if f (x) < f(xo) for all x in the intersection of domain f and some interval
centered at x0 (even if x0 is
an end-point of the domain off).
The minimum and a relative minimum
off are defined in a similar
way.
Figure 31.1 shows a function
with domain I[a,b] having:
max. f(b),
rel. max. f (b), f (xl), and f(x3) a xl x2 I x3 x4 xb b
min. f (x2),
rel. min. f(a), f(x2), and f(x5). Figure 31.1
THEOREM 31.1. Let f be a function and x0 a number such that f'(xo)
exists and f'(xo) 0 0. Then f(xo) is neither a relative maximum nor a relative
minimum Off.
PROOF. CASE 1. f'(xo) > 0. Choose a number E > 0 such that
0 < f'(xo) - E. Let 6 > 0{ be such that whenever 0 < Ix - x01 < 6 then
(1) -E <J (x) -J (x0) -J '(x0) < E.
x - X0
Hence, from the left hand inequality only, whenever x0 - S < x < x0 or
x0 < x < x0 + 6, then
0 < f'(X0) - E < f (X) - f(x0)
x-X0
The numerator is negative if -S < x - x0 < 0, but is positive if
0 < x - x0 < 6. Thus f (xo) is neither a relative maximum nor a relative
minimum off.
CASE 2. f'(xo) < 0. The proof is similar; by choosing 0 < E < f'(x0)
and using the right hand inequality of (1).
DEFINITION. A critical value for a function f on I[a,b] is any value
x0, a < x0 < b, such that either:
x0 = a, x0 = b, f'(xo) = 0, or f' does not exist at x0.
A logical deduction from Theorem 31.1 is:
COROLLARY. On a closed interval I[a,b], a relative maximum or relative
minimum of a function f can occur only at a critical value for f on I[a,b].
Note that f = {(x,y) I y = x - (the greatest integer < x)} has no maximum
(even on I[0,1]), since each value off is actually <1, but f has values greater
than any given number <1.
The function {(x, y) I y = x + I fix} has neither a maximum nor a minimum
on l[ - 1, 1].92 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
It is, however, true that:
THEOREM 31.2. If a function f is continuous on a closed interval I[a,b], then
f has a maximum, and a minimum on I [a,b]; that is, there are numbers x and 9
such that a < x < b, a < z < b, and if a < x < b, then
f(x) < f(x) < f(X).
This theorem is proved in Appendix A2. In particular, Theorem 31.2
and the corollary to Theorem 31.1 imply the validity of the following test,
which may be applied to determine the maximum and minimum values of a
continuous function on a closed interval.
TEST 1. The maximum and minimum of a continuous function on a closed
interval I[a,b] may be obtained as follows:
(i) Find all critical values off on I[a,b]; that is, note a and b, find all
solutions off '(x) = 0 which are in I(a,b), and find all values of x in I(a,b) which
are not in the domain off'.
(ii) Compute f(x) for x each of the critical values and among the numbers
obtained, the largest is the maximum and the smallest is the minimum off on
I[a,b].
Example 1. For f the function defined by
f (x) = x1/3(x - 3)2/3, -1 < x < 4
find all critical values. Also, find the maximum and the minimum off on I[-1,4].

Solution. From derivative formulas developed earlier

PX) = 3 (x - 3)1/3 + 3 x2/3 x2/3(x - 3)1/3
for x 0 0 and x 0 3.
Thus, critical values off on I[-1,4] are:
x = -1, x = 4 (end points of the interval)
x = I (since f'(1) = 0)
x = 0, and x = 3 (values on I[-1,4] but not in the domain of f')
Now f(-1) (-1)1/3(-4)2/3 = -"16, f(4) = ti'4, f(l) = 11/3(_2)2/3 =
f(0), = 0, and f(3) = 0. Thus, the minimum value of the function is - X16Sec. 31 Maxima and Minima 93
(occurring when x = -1), whereas the maximum value is f4 (occurring both when
x = 1 and when x = 4). Figure 31.2 is a graph of f.
The following examples illustrate applications of maxima and minima.
Example 2. A pan is to be made from a rectangle of tin 6 in. x 10 in. by cutting
squares of side x in. from each corner and turning up the
tin to form the sides and ends of the pan. Find the pan of
largest volume which can be so made.
Solution. The pan will have length 10 - 2x in., breadth
6 - 2x in., where 0 S x < 3, depth x in., and thus volume
V(x) in3 where
V(x) = (10 - 2x)(6 - 2x)x
= 4(x3 - 8x2 + 15x), 0 < x - 3.
Since V(x) = 4(3x2 - 16x + 15) exists for x on I(0,3],
and on this interval the only solution of V'(x) = 0 is
8-"19
x = 3

we see that-this value together with x = 0 and x = 3 are the only critical values.

Since V(0) = 0 and V(3) = 0, whereas V
(t8 -

V
) > 0, it follows that (to
within slide rule accuracy) the values of x to use and the maximum volume are

Example 3. At 1230' (Navy time) one ship is steaming north at 12 knots and
is 25 nautical miles due south of a second ship steaming due west at 9 knots. Find
when the ships are closest together and their distance apart at
9t T this time.
Solution. Starting to measure time t in hours from the
i I described instant, the number s(t) of miles apart, and an
appropriate time interval are (see Fig. 31.4),
25
12t
s(t) = \/(25 - 12t)2 + (9t)2, 0 < t < 25/12.
Since s'(t) =
2(25 - 12t)(-12) + 2(9t)9
2s(t)
75(-4 + 3t) 25
Figure 31.4 = s(t) 0 < t <
12'
we see that s'(t) = 0 if and only if t = a = 11201. The critical values are thus
t=0,t=eiandt=!. Since
s(0) = 25, s(s) = 15, and s(I) = 4,
the closest approach occurs at 1230' + 1'20' = 1350' and this shortest distance is
15 nautical miles.94 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
In solving such problems a sequence of steps to follow is:
1) Express the quantity to be maximized or minimized as a function.
[The problem may be stated in terms of letters as constants, and it may be
convenient to introduce new letters to express the given relations. Then, by
using conditions of the problem, all except two of the introduced letters must
be eliminated (one of them representing a function expressed in terms of the
other as independent variable).]
2) For the independent variable, determine the significant interval whose
end points are therefore critical values.
3) Determine additional critical values by examining the derivative of the
function.
4) Since the largest and smallest values of the function (whichever is
pertinent to the problem) occur at critical values, determine the desired
maximum or minimum.
Example 4. Of all right circular cones inscribed in a sphere of radius R, find the
one having largest volume.
Solution. For this problem R is a constant. A right circular cone of radius r
and altitude h has volume V where
Figure 31.5
V = 3rrr2h.
Since, however, the cone is inscribed in a sphere of
radius R, then (see Fig. 31.5) r, h, and R are related by
r2 = R2 - (h - R)2 = 2Rh - h2.
Thus, the volume in terms of h and bounds for h are
V(h) = 37(2Rh - h2)h, R 5 h < 2R.
Since V'(h) = 3ir(4Rh - 3h2) 3irh(4R - 3h), the only
additional critical value of h is h = 4R/3. A check
shows that V(R) = 3rrR3, V(2R) = 0, and V(3R) =
81 IrR3. Thus, the largest possible volume is $-rrR3.

32. A Mean Value Theorem
The theorems proved in this section have immediate applications in
maximum and minimum considerations, but are used again in Chap. 4 and
form the basis of much of the development in Chap. 12.
THEOREM 32.1 (Rolle's Theorem).
Let g be a function such that
(i) g is continuous on a closed
(a,0) interval I[a,b],
(xo,o) (b,O) (ii) g' exists on the open interval
I(a,b), and
Figure 32.1 (iii) g(a) = g(b) = 0.
Then there is a number x0 such that
(1) a < xo < b and g'(xo) = 0.
PROOF. Since g is continuous on the closed interval I[a,b], it has a
maximum M and a minimum m on this interval. (See Theorem 31.2.)
Consider. three cases.
CASE 1. M > 0. Let x0 be on I[a,b] and g(xo) = M. Then by (iii)
(2) a < xo < b.
Thus, g'(xo) exists because of (ii), but then g'(xo) = 0 because of Theorem
31.1. Then (1) holds in this case.
CASE 2. m < 0. The proof is similar to the proof in Case 1.
CASE 3. M < 0 and m z 0. Since m < M we have M = m = 0 so that
g is constant on I[a,b]. Thus, g'(x) = 0 for a < x < b and we select for x0
any number in I(a,b).
Since these cases include all possibilities, the proof is complete.
Rolle's Theorem is used in proving the Mean Value Theorem for
derivatives, which is sometimes called the Law of the Mean for derivatives.
THEOREM 32.2 (Mean Value Theorem for Derivatives). Let f be a junction
which satisfies the conditions:
(i) f is continuous on the closed interval I[a,b],
(ii) f' exists on the open interval I(a,b).Sec. 32 A Mean Value Theorem
Then there is a number in the open interval I(a,b) such that
(3) f(b) = f(a) -}- (b - a < < b.
PROOF. Let g be the function defined on I[a,b] by
(4) g(x) =.f(x) -f(bb - a(a) (_): - a) - f(a), a < x < b.
97
(Note: A way of remembering (4) is to write the equation of the chord joining
(a,f(a)) to (b,f(b)) as
(5)
(b) -,f (a)
Y b - a (x - a) ± f(a),
and then subtracting this expression fromf(x) to see thatg(x) is the vertical distance
(or its negative) between points of the curve and the chord.)
By substituting into (4), g(a) _
g(b) = 0 and since
g,(x) =.f '(x) - f(b) - f(a)
b-a
a<x<b a,01 (x,0) (i;,0) (b,0)
Figure 32.2
the conditions of Rolle's Theorem are satisfied. Hence there is a number
such that a < < b and g'(e) = 0; i.e.
0 f(b) - f(a) b-a
which is equivalent to (3).
A geometric interpretation of Theorem 32.2 is: On a smooth arc there is
a point where the tangent is parallel to the chord.
DEFINITION. A function f is said to be non-decreasing on I[a,b] if
whenever x1 and x2 are numbers such that a < x1 < x2 < b, then
(6) f (x1) :-<f(x2)-
By replacing (6) by f (xo > f(x2) the definition off being non-increasing is
obtained. j-
THEOREM 32.3. If f is a continuous function on I[a,b], if f' exists on I(a,b),
and
(i) if f'(x)' > O for a < x < b, then f is non-decreasing on I[a,b], but
(ii) if f'(x) S O for a < x < b, then f is non-increasing on I[a,b].
t Some books use "monotonically increasing" in place of "non-decreasing," and
"monotonically decreasing" in place of "non-increasing."98 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
PROOF. Assuming f satisfies the conditions (i), let x1 and x2 be numbers
such that a < x1 < x2 < b. Then the conditions of Theorem 32.2 are
satisfied on the interval I[x1,x2]. Thus, let x0 be such that
(1) x1 < x0 < x2 and f(x2) = f(x1) + (x2 - xl)f'(XO)
Hence, a < x0 < b so that f'(x0) 0 whereas x2 - xl > 0 and thus
f (x2) - f (x1) _ (x2 - x1)f'(x0) > 0.
Consequently f(x1) < f(x2), which states that f is non-decreasing on I[a,b].
In case (ii) all statements down to and including (1) hold, but now
(x2 - x1) f'(x0) < 0 so that f(xl) > f'(x2) and f is non-increasing on I[a,b].
A paraphrase of Theorem 32.3 is the following test which may be used in
connection with maximum-minimum problems. (See p. 92 for Test I.)
C
Figure 32.3 Figure 32.4
C
TEST II. For f a continuous function and
TT1 f <o c in the domain off, if f'(c) does not exist or if f '(c) = 0, then the value off (c) is:
'<0 (i) A relative maximum (see Fig. 32.3)
C
Figure 32.5
C
if there are numbers x1 < c < x2
such that f' z 0 on I(x1,c) but
f S 0 on I(c,x2).
(ii) A relative minimum (see Fig. 32.4)
if f' < 0 on I(x1,c) but f' > 0 on I(c,x2).
(iii) Neither a relative maximum nor a relative
minimum (see Fig. 32.5) if f has the same
sign in both I(x1,c) and I(c,x2).
Example 1. Find the relative maximum and relative 1 (1,2)
minimum of the function f defined by
1 f (x) = x+ x, x 0 0,
(0,1)
Solution. Since x = 0 is not in the domain off and
since
1 x2-1
f '(X) = 1 - X2 = x2 for x 0 0,
there is no critical value where the derivative fails to Figure 32.6Sec. 32 A Mean Value Theorem 99
exist. The only critical values are solutions off '(x) = 0; namely, x =- .. 1. Since
f' > 0 on I(-2,-1), but f' < 0 on I(-1,0), then f(-1) = -2
is a relative maximum,
f < 0 on 1(0,1), but f ' > 0 on 1(1,2), then f (1) = 2 is a relative minimum.
This example shows that a function may thus have a relative maximum
less than a relative minimum.
Example 2. Given f defined by f(x) = (x - 1)3(x - 3) + 1, determine all
relative maxima and minima.
Solution. f '(x) = (x - 1)3 + (x - 3) 3(x - 1)2 = 2(x - 1)2(2x - 5). Hence,
f'(x) exists for all x and f'(x) = 0 if either
x = 1 or x = 2. Moreover (x - 1)2 is
never negative and
f'(x) < 0 if x < 1 or if 1 < x < 2, (1,1)
(3,1)
f'(x)>0 if x>2.
Hence, this function has no relative maximum
and the only relative minimum (see
Fig. 32.7) is f(2) = -is
This example shows that a function 5 11 may have a derivative equal to zero z' 16
without having a maximum or minimum Figure 32.7

A point of a curve [such as (1,1) of Fig. 32.7] where the tangent is
horizontal with the curve above the tangent on one side and below on the
other, is called a point of horizontal inflection.
Example 3. A vertical post with square cross section 1 ft x 1 ft is set squarely
on a cubical block 3 ft on a side. Supports from the floor to the sides of the post
are desired. Find the inside length of the shortest possible support.
Solution. For a support making an angle 0
with the floor (see Fig 32.8), the inside length
L(8) is given by
(7) L(0) = 3 csc 0 + sec 0, 0 < 0 < 7r/2.
1 i \3\ We first find (see page 80, Example and Prob. 6)
L'(0) 3 csc 6 cot 0 + sec 8 tan 6
3 cos3 0 + sin3 0 7r
0 <0 <-sine 8 cost 0 2
Figure 32.8
Hence, L'(0) = 0 only if the angle 0 is such that
sin3 0 = 3 cos3 0; that is,
(8) tan 6 = 31/3, 0 < 0 <7r/2.100 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
Moreover L'(0) is negative for 0 close to 0, but L'(B) is positive for B close to 7r/2,
and hence the value of 0 for which (8) holds will make (7) a
minimum. From Fig. 32.9 in which tan 0 = 31/3, the value of
csc 0 and sec 0 may be read off to give the minimum length as
3V3 2/3 + 1 + V3213 + 1 = (32/3 + 1)3/2.

33. Points of Inflection
Given a function f, then f ' is its derived function, and f " is (as defined in
Sec. 27) its second derived function. We may thus apply the Law of the
Mean for derivatives (see Theorem 32.2) to the function f'; that is,
Let f be a junction such that
(i) f' is continuous on a closed interval I[a,b] and
(ii) f " exists on the open interval I(a,b),
and let c and d be any two distinct numbers on I[a,b]. Then between c and d
there is a number 77 such that
f'(d) = f'(c) + (d - c) f "(9i)
This fact will be used presently. First, we give a definition in which an
"arc" of a graph means "a connected portion of the graph."
DEFINITION. An arc of a graph is said to be:
(i) concave upward if each point of the arc is above the tangent to any
other point of the arc, but
(ii) concave downward if each point of the arc is below the tangent to
any other point of the arc.
As an illustration, for the graph in Fig.
33.1 the arc between S and T is concave
upward, the arc between T and U is concave
downward, and the arc between U
and V is concave upward.
THEOREM 33.1. For a function f, an arc
of the graph of ,f is concave upward if
throughout this arc f " > 0, but is concave
downward if everywhere on the arc f " < 0.
Figure 33.1
PROOF. Under the condition that f"(x) > 0 for a < x < b, we prove
that the arc between (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)) is concave upward.
Let x1 be any number such that a < x1 < b. The tangent to the are at
(xl, f(xl)) has equation
Y = f(x1) + f'(x1)(x - x1).
We shall show that every point of the arc is above this tangent, except the
point (xl, f (x1)) of contact, by showing that
(1) f(x2) > f(x1) + f'(xl)(x2 - x1) for x2 0 x1, but a < x2 < b.
To do so, we first use the Law of the Mean to obtain
(2) f(x2) = f(x1) + f'(X3)(X2 - X1) with x3 between x1 and x2.102 Applications of Derivatives Chap. 3
Next we apply the Law of the Mean to the derived function f to obtain
f'(x3) = f'(x1) - f "(x4)(x3 - x1) with x4 between xl and x3.
This expression forf'(x3) substituted into (2) yields
(3) f (x2) =f(XI) T f '(x1)(x2 - xl) + f "(x4)(x3 - l)(x2 - xl)
The last term in (3) is positive. For if x1 < x2 then xl < x3 < x2 so that
0 <x3-x,. and 0 < x2 - xl, but if x2 < xl then x2 < x3 < xl so that
x3 - xl < 0 and x2 - x1 < 0. In either case (x3 - x1)(x2 - x1) > 0. Thus
the last term in (3) is positive since we are under the condition that f"(x) > 0
for all x between a and b.
Consequently, by dropping the last term from the equality (3) we obtain
the inequality (1). Hence the arc is concave upward under the condition
f"(x)>Ofora<x.<b.
The condition f"(x) < 0 for a < x < b leads again to (3), but this time
with the last term negative (as should be checked). Consequently the inequality
in (1) is reversed, showing the arc to be concave downward.

Example 1. With a and b positive
constants, find the concave upward and
concave downward portions of the graph
of the function f defined by
a
f(x) = x2 + b2 .

Solution. We first compute
3x2 - b2
f '(x) = (x2 + b2)2
and f (x) = 2a (x2 + b2)3'
and note that f "(x) > 0 if 3x2 - b2 > 0, but f "(x) < 0 if 3x2 - b2 < 0. Thus,
f "W > 0 if either x > b/ V3 or x < -b/ V3, but
f "(x) < 0 if -b/'/3 < x < b/V 3.
The concave upward portions are therefore separated from the concave downward
portion by the points (see Fig. 33.2)

From Theorem 33.1, a portion of the graph of a function where f' > 0
is concave upward but a portion where f " < 0 is concave downwardSec. 33 Points of Inflection 103
Thus, if xi is such that.f'(xl) = 0 and f "(xl) > 0, then the point (x1, f(x1))
is the lowest point on a concave upward portion of the graph off, whereas
if f'(xl) = 0 and f"(xl) < 0 then the point
(xl, f(xl)) is the highest point on a concave
downward portion. See Fig. 33.3. We therefore
have a third test for determining relative
maxima and minima of a function. (For Test
I see p. 92, and for Test II see p. 98.) 1
J 'U t"<0
TEST III. If f is a function and x1 is a
number such that f '(x1) = 0 and f "(xl) exists,
then the value f'(xl) is:
Figure 33.3
(i) A relative minimum off provided f "(x) > 0.
(ii) A relative maximum of f provided f "(x1) < 0.
(iii) Not applicable if f "(xl) = 0 or if f "(x) does not exist.
Example 2. Find the relative maxima and minima of the function f defined by
f (x) = 2 cos x - cos 2x, -7r < x < Tr.
Solution. J "(x) _ -2 sin x + 2 sin 2x = -2 sin x + 4 sin x cos x
= 2 sin x(2 cos x - 1) = 0
if x = -1r, -7r/3, 0, n/3, or Tr. For Test III we also need
f "(x) = -2 cos x + 4 cos 2x.
Now f "(-7r) = 2 + 4 > 0, so f(--ir) = -3 is a relative minimum,
f'( -a/3) _ -1 - 2 < 0, so f(-rr/3) _ ; is a relative maximum,
f "(0) = -2 + 4 > 0, so f (O) = 1 is a relative minimum,
f "(7r/3) = -1 - 2 < 0, so f(7r13) = 2 is a relative maximum,
f "(ir) = 2 + 4 > 0, so f(ir) = -3 is a relative minimum.
Example 3. In a homogeneous medium, light travels in a straight line at constant
velocity depending upon the medium. Let the velocity of light in air be vi and in
water be v2. Show that a light ray from a source S in air to an object 0 under calm
water will travel in the shortest time (as it does travel) if
(5)

where ai and a2 are the angles the ray in air and water makes, respectively, with the
normal to the surface.
Solution. A ray from S to a point P on the surface and then to 0, would do so
in time T(x) where (see Fig. 33.4 for the meaning of x, a, b, and c)
T(x) - -,/a2 + x2 + /b2 + (c - x)2

Since T'(x) =

Since sin al = x/''a2 + x2 and sin a2 =
(c - x)/Vb2 + (c - x)2, we see that if (6)
holds, then (5) also holds.
There might be some doubt as to whether
the value of x which satisfies (6) actually
gives the minimum value of T. By taking
the second derivative and simplifying:
1 a2 I b2
T-(x)
= vl (Va2 + x2)2 + v2 (V'b2 + (c --X)2)'
which is positive for all x. Thus, the whole graph of T is concave upward so the only
place where T' is zero [namely, when (6) is satisfied] does furnish the minimum
value of T.
DEFINITION. A point of a graph is said to be a point of inflection if at
this point the tangent to the graph lies above an arc on one side and below an
arc on the other side.
Thus, in Fig. 33.1 the points S, T, U, and V are points of inflection. Also,
the graph in Fig. 33.2 has two points of inflection.
For the graph of a function f, any arc where f " > 0 is concave upward,
and any portion where f " < 0 is concave downward. Thus, at a point of
inflection f " can be neither positive nor negative. Consequently:
If (x0, f(xo)) is a point of inflection, then either f "(xo) exists and is
zero or else f "(xo) does not exist.
It therefore follows that the abscissas of all points of inflection will be found
among the solutions off "(x) = 0 together with all values of x which are not
in the domain off ". Note, however, that evbn if x0 is such that f "(xo) = 0
it may possibly be that (xo, f(xo)) is not an inflection point. For example,
the function f defined by
f(x) _ (x - 1)4
is such that f"(x) = 12(x - 1)2 so f "(1) = 0, but f"(x) > 0 for x 0 1 and
the whole curve is concave upward with no point of inflection.
