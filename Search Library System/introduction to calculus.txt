Introduction to Vectors
Scalars are quantities with magnitude only whereas vectors are those quantities
having both a magnitude and a direction. Vectors are used to model a variety
of fundamental processes occurring in engineering, physics and the sciences. The
material presented in the pages that follow investigates both scalar and vectors
quantities and operations associated with their use in solving applied problems. In
particular, differentiation and integration techniques associated with both scalar and
vector quantities will be investigated.
Vectors and Scalars
A vector is any quantity which possesses both magnitude and direction.
A scalar is a quantity which possesses a magnitude but does not possess
a direction.
Examples of vector quantities are force, velocity, acceleration, momentum,
weight, torque, angular velocity, angular acceleration, angular momentum.
Examples of scalar quantities are time, temperature, size of an angle, energy,
mass, length, speed, density

Scalar multiplication.
A vector can be represented by an arrow. The
orientation of the arrow determines the direction of
the vector, and the length of the arrow is associated
with the magnitude of the vector. The magnitude
of a vector B is denoted | B | or B and represents
the length of the vector. The tail end of the arrow
is called the origin, and the arrowhead is called the
terminus. Vectors are usually denoted by letters in
bold face type. When a bold face type is inconvenient
to use, then a letter with an arrow over it
is employed, such as,  A, B, C. Throughout this text the arrow notation is used in
all discussions of vectors.
Properties of Vectors
Some important properties of vectors are
1. Two vectors A and B are equal if they have the same magnitude (length) and
direction. Equality is denoted by A = B.2
2. The magnitude of a vector is a nonnegative scalar quantity. The magnitude of a
vector B is denoted by the symbols B or |B|.
3. A vector B is equal to zero only if its magnitude is zero. A vector whose magnitude
is zero is called the zero or null vector and denoted by the symbol 0.
4. Multiplication of a nonzero vector B by a positive scalar m is denoted by mB and
produces a new vector whose direction is the same as B but whose magnitude is
m times the magnitude of B . Symbolically, |mB | = m|B |. If m is a negative scalar
the direction of mB is opposite to that of the direction of B. In figure 6-1 several
vectors obtained from B by scalar multiplication are exhibited.
5. Vectors are considered as “free vectors”. The term “free vector” is used to mean
the following. Any vector may be moved to a new position in space provided
that in the new position it is parallel to and has the same direction as its original
position. In many of the examples that follow, there are times when a given
vector is moved to a convenient point in space in order to emphasize a special
geometrical or physical concept. See for example figure 6-1.
Vector Addition and Subtraction
Let C = A + B denote the sum of two vectors A and B . To find the vector sum
A
+B , slide the origin of the vector B to the terminus point of the vector A, then draw
the line from the origin of A to the terminus of B to represent C . Alternatively, start
with the vector B and place the origin of the vector A at the terminus point of B to
construct the vector B + A. Adding vectors in this way employs the parallelogramlaw
for vector addition which is illustrated in the figure 6-2. Note that vector addition is
commutative. That is, using the shifted vectors A and B , as illustrated in the figure
6-2, the commutative law for vector addition A + B = B + A , is illustrated using the
parallelogram illustrated. The addition of vectors can be thought of as connecting
the origin and terminus of directed line segments.
Figure 6-2. Parallelogram law for vector addition3
If F = A - B denotes the difference of two vectors A and B , then F is determined
by the above rule for vector addition by writing F = A + (-B ). Thus, subtraction
of the vector B from the vector A is represented by the addition of the vector -B
to A. In figure 6-2 observe that the vectors A and B are free vectors and have
been translated to appropriate positions to illustrate the concepts of addition and
subtraction. The sum of two or more force vectors is sometimes referred to as the
resultant force. In general, the resultant force acting on an object is calculated by
using a vector addition of all the forces acting on the object.
Vectors constitute a group under the operation of addition. That is, the following
four properties are satisfied.
1. Closure property If A and B belong to a set of vectors, then their sum A + B
must also belong to the same set.
2. Associative property The insertion of parentheses or grouping of terms in vector
summation is immaterial. That is,
(A + B ) + C = A + (B + C ) (6.50)
3. Identity element The zero or null vector when added to a vector does not produce
a new vector. In symbols, A +0 = A . The null vector is called the identity element
under addition.
4. Inverse element If to each vector A, there is associated a vector E such that
under addition these two vectors produce the identity element, and A + E = 0,
then the vector E is called the inverse of Aunder vector addition and is denoted
by E = -A .
Additional properties satisfied by vectors include
5. Commutative law If in addition all vectors of the group satisfy A +B = B +A , then
the set of vectors is said to form a commutative group under vector addition.
6. Distributive law The distributive law with respect to scalar multiplication is
m(A + B ) = mA + mB , where m is a scalar. (6.51)
Definition (Linear combination)
If there exists constants c1, c2, . . . , cn, not all zero, together with a set of vectors
A
1, A 2, . . . , A n, such that
A
= c1A 1 + c2A2 + · · · + cnAn,
then the vector A is said to be a linear combination of the vectors A 1, A2, . . . , An.4
Definition (Linear dependence and independence of vectors)
Two nonzero vectors A and B are said to be linearly dependent if it is possible
to find scalars k1, k2 not both zero, such that the equation
k1A + k2B = 0 (6.3)
is satisfied. If k1 = 0 and k2 = 0 are the only scalars for which the above equation
is satisfied, then the vectors A and B are said to be linearly independent.
This definition can be interpreted geometrically. If k1 = 0, then equation (6.3)
implies that A = -
k2
k1
B
= mB showing that A is a scalar multiple of B . That is, A and
B
have the same direction and therefore, they are called colinear vectors. If A and
B
are not colinear, then they are linearly independent (noncolinear). If two nonzero
vectors A and B are linearly independent, then any vector C lying in the plane of
A
and B can be expressed as a linear combination of the these vectors. Construct
as in figure 6-3 a parallelogram with diagonal C and sides parallel to the vectors A
and B when their origins are made to coincide.
Figure 6-3. Vector C is a linear combination of vectors A and B .
Since the vector side
-®
DE is parallel to B and the vector side
-®
EF is parallel to A, then
there exists scalars m and n such that
-®
DE = mB and
-®
EF = nA. With vector addition,
C
=
-®
DE +
-®
EF = mB + nA (6.54)
which shows that C is a linear combination of the vectors A and B .5
Example 6-1. Show that the medians of a triangle meet at a trisection point.
Figure 6-4. Constructing medians of a triangle
Solution: Let the sides of a triangle with vertices a, b, g be denoted by the vectors
A
, B , and A - B as illustrated in the figure 6-4. Further, let a, b
, g denote the
vectors from the respective vertices of a, b, g to the midpoints of the opposite sides.
By using the above definitions one can construct the following vector equations
A
+ a =
1

B
B
+
1
2
(A - B ) = b
B
+g =
1
2
A.
(
6.5)
Let the vectors a and b
intersect at a point designated by P, Similarly, let the vectors
b
and g intersect at the point designated P*. The problem is to show that the points
P and P* are the same. Figures 6-4(b) and 6-4(c) illustrate that for suitable scalars
k, , m, n, the points P and P* determine the vectors equations
A
+ a = mb
and B + ng = kb
. (6.6)
In these equations the scalars k, , m, n are unknowns to be determined. Use the
set of equations (6.5), to solve for the vectors a, b
, g in terms of the vectors A and
B
and show
a =
1
2
B
- A
b
=
1
2
(A + B ) g =
1
2
A
- B . (6.7)
These equations can now be substituted into the equations (6.6) to yield, after some
simplification, the equations
(1 -  -
m
2
)A = (
m
2
-

2
)B and (
k
2
-
n
2
)A = (1 - n -
k
2
)B .
Since the vectors A and B are linearly independent (noncolinear), the scalar coefficients
in the above equation must equal zero, because if these scalar coefficients
were not zero, then the vectors A and B would be linearly dependent (colinear)6
and a triangle would not exist. By equating to zero the scalar coefficients in these
equations, there results the simultaneous scalar equations
(1 -  -
m
2
) = 0, (
m
2
-

2
) = 0, (
k
2
-
n
2
) = 0, (1 - n -
k
2
) = 0
The solution of these equations produces the fact that k =  = m = n =
2
3
and hence
the conclusion P = P* is a trisection point.
Unit Vectors
A vector having length or magnitude of one is called a unit vector. If A is
a nonzero vector of length |A|, a unit vector in the direction of A is obtained by
multiplying the vector A by the scalar m = 1
|A|
. The unit vector so constructed is
denoted
ˆeA =
A
|A|
and satisfies | ˆeA| = 1.
The symbol ˆe is reserved for unit vectors and the notation ˆeA is to be read “a unit
vector in the direction of A .” The hat or carat (  ) notation is used to represent
a unit vector or normalized vector.
Figure 6-5. Cartesian axes.
The figure 6-5 illustrates unit base vectors ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3 in the directions of the positive
x, y, z-coordinate axes in a rectangular three dimensional cartesian coordinate
system. These unit base vectors in the direction of the x, y, z axes have historically7
been represented by a variety of notations. Some of the more common notations
employed in various textbooks to denote rectangular unit base vectors are
ˆi, ˆ, ˆk, ˆex, ˆey, ˆez, ˆi1, ˆi2, ˆi3, 1x, 1y, 1z , ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3
The notation ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3 to represent the unit base vectors in the direction of the
x, y, z axes will be used in the discussions that follow as this notation makes it easier
to generalize vector concepts to n-dimensional spaces.
Scalar or Dot Product (inner product)
The scalar or dot product of two vectors is sometimes referred to as an inner
product of vectors.
Definition (Dot product) The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B
is denoted
A
· B = |A | |B | cos q, (6.8)
and represents the magnitude of A times the magnitude B times the cosine of q,
where q is the angle between the vectors A and B when their origins are made to
coincide.
The angle between any two of the orthogonal unit base vectors ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3 in
cartesian coordinates is 90 or p
2 radians. Using the results cos p
2 = 0 and cos 0 = 1,
there results the following dot product relations for these unit vectors
ˆe1 · ˆe1 = 1
ˆe1 · ˆe2 = 0
ˆe1 · ˆe3 = 0
ˆe2 · ˆe1 = 0
ˆe2 · ˆe2 = 1
ˆe2 · ˆe3 = 0
ˆe3 · ˆe1 = 0
ˆe3 · ˆe2 = 0
ˆe3 · ˆe3 = 1
(6.9)
Using an index notation the above dot products can be expressed ˆei · ˆej = dij
where the subscripts i and j can take on any of the integer values 1, 2, 3. Here dij is
the Kronecker delta symbol1 defined by dij =

1, i = j
0, i = j
.
The dot product satisfies the following properties
Commutative law A · B = B · A
Distributive law A · (B + C ) = A · B + A · C
Magnitude squared A · A = A2 = |A|2
which are proved using the definition of a dot product.
1 Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891) A German mathematician.8
The physical interpretation of projection can be assigned to the dot product as
is illustrated in figure 6-6. In this figure A and B are nonzero vectors with ˆeA and
ˆeB unit vectors in the directions of A and B , respectively. The figure 6-6 illustrates
the physical interpretation of the following equations:
ˆeB · A = |A| cos q = Projection of A onto direction of ˆeB
ˆeA · B = |B | cos q = Projection of B onto direction of ˆeA.
In general, the dot product of a nonzero vector A with a unit vector ˆe is given
by A · ˆe = ˆe · A = |A|| ˆe| cos q and represents the projection of the given vector onto
the direction of the unit vector. The dot product of a vector with a unit vector
is a basic fundamental concept which arises in a variety of science and engineering
applications.
Figure 6-6. Projection of one vector onto another.
Observe that if the dot product of two vectors is zero, A · B = |A||B| cos q = 0,
then this implies that either A= 0, B = 0, or q = p
2 . If A and B are both nonzero
vectors and their dot product is zero, then the angle between these vectors, when
their origins coincide, must be q = p
2 . One can then say the vector A is perpendicular
to the vector B or one can state that the projection of B on A is zero. If A and B are
nonzero vectors and A · B = 0, then the vectors A and B are said to be orthogonal
vectors.
Direction Cosines Associated With Vectors
Let A be a nonzero vector having its origin at the origin of a rectangular cartesian
coordinate system. The dot products9
A
· ˆe1 = A1 A · ˆe2 = A2 A · ˆe3 = A3 (6.10)
represent respectively, the components or projections of the vector A onto the x, y
and z-axes. The projections A1, A2, A3 of the vector A onto the coordinate axes
are scalars which are called the components of the vector A . From the definition of
the dot product of two vectors, the scalar components of the vector A satisfy the
equations
A1 = A · ˆe1 = |A| cosa, A2 = A · ˆe2 = |A| cos b, A3 = A · ˆe3 = |A | cos g, (6.11)
where a, b, g are respectively, the smaller angles between the vector A and the
x, y, z coordinate axes. The cosine of these angles are referred to as the direction
cosines of the vector A. These angles are illustrated in figure 6-7.
Figure 6-7. Unit vectors ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3 and ˆeA = cos a ˆe1 + cos b ˆe2 + cos g ˆe3
The vector quantities
A
1 = A1 ˆe1, A2 = A2 ˆe2, A3 = A3 ˆe3 (6.12)
are called the vector components of the vector A . From the addition property of
vectors, the vector components of A may be added to obtain
A
= A1 ˆe1 + A2 ˆe2 + A3 ˆe3 = |A|(cosa ˆe1 + cos b ˆe2 + cos g ˆe3) = |A | ˆeA (6.13)
This vector representation A = A1 ˆe1 + A2 ˆe2 + A3 ˆe3 is called the component form of
the vector A and the unit vector ˆeA = cos a ˆe1 + cos b ˆe2 + cos g ˆe3 is a unit vector in
the direction of A .10
Any numbers proportional to the direction cosines of a line are called the direction
numbers of the line. Show for a : b : c the direction numbers of a line which
are not all zero, then the direction cosines are given by
cos a =
a
r
cos b =
b
r
cos g =
c
r
,
where r =
Ö
a2 + b2 + c2.
Example 6-2.
Sketch a large version of the letter H. Consider
the sides of the letter H as parallel lines a
distance of p units apart. Place a unit vector ˆe
perpendicular to the left side of H and pointing
toward the right side of H. Construct a vector x1
which runs from the origin of ˆe to a point on the
right side of the H. Observe that ˆe · x1 = p is a
projection of x1 on ˆe. Now construct another vector x2, different from x1, again from
the origin of ˆe to the right side of the H. Note also that ˆe · x2 = p is a projection
of x2 on the vector ˆe. Draw still another vector x, from the origin of ˆe to the right
side of H which is different from x1 and x2. Observe that the dot product ˆe · x = p
representing the projection of x on ˆe still produces the value p.
Assume you are given ˆe and p and are asked to solve the vector equation ˆe· x = p
for the unknown quantity x. You might think that there is some operation like vector
division, for example x = p/ˆe, whereby x can be determined. However, if you look
at the equation ˆe · x = p as a projection, one can observe that there would be an
infinite number of solutions to this equation and for this reason there is no division
of vector quantities.
Component Form for Dot Product
Let A , B be two nonzero vectors represented in the component form
A
= A1 ˆe1 + A2 ˆe2 + A3 ˆe3, B = B1 ˆe1 + B1 ˆe2 + B3 ˆe3
The dot product of these two vectors is
A
· B = (A1 ˆe1 + A2 ˆe2 + A3 ˆe3) · (B1 ˆe1 + B1 ˆe2 + B3 ˆe3) (6.14)11
and this product can be expanded utilizing the distributive and commutative laws
to obtain
A
· B = A1B1 ˆe1 · ˆe1 + A1B2 ˆe1 · ˆe2 + A1B3 ˆe1 · ˆe3
+ A2B1 ˆe2 · ˆe1 + A2B2 ˆe2 · ˆe2 + A2B3 ˆe2 · ˆe3
+ A3B1 ˆe3 · ˆe1 + A3B2 ˆe3 · ˆe2 + A3B3 ˆe3 · ˆe3.
(6.15)
From the previous properties of the dot product of unit vectors, given by equations
(6.9), the dot product reduces to the form
A
· B = A1B1 + A2B2 + A3B3. (6.16)
Thus, the dot product of two vectors produces a scalar quantity which is the sum of
the products of like components.
From the definition of the dot product the following useful relationship results:
A
· B = A1B1 + A2B2 + A3B3 = |A ||B | cos q. (6.17)
This relation may be used to find the angle between two vectors when their origins
are made to coincide and their components are known. If in equation (6.17) one
makes the substitution A = B , there results the special formula
A
· A = A21
+ A22
+ A23
= A · Acos 0 = A2 = |A|
2
. (6.18)
Consequently, the magnitude of a vector A is given by the square root of the sum of
the squares of its components or |A | =

A
· A=

A21
+ A22
+ A23
The previous dot product definition is motivated
by the law of cosines as the following arguments
demonstrate. Consider three points having
the coordinates (0, 0, 0), (A1,A2,A3), and (B1,B2,B3)
and plot these points in a cartesian coordinate system
as illustrated. Denote by A the directed line
segment from (0, 0, 0) to (A1,A2,A3) and denote by
B
the directed straight-line segment from (0, 0, 0) to
(B1,B2,B3).
One can now apply the distance formula from analytic geometry to represent
the lengths of these line segments. We find these lengths can be represented by
| A| =

A21
+ A22
+ A23
and |B| =

B2
1 + B2
2 + B2
3 .12
Let C = A - B denote the directed line segment from (B1,B2,B3) to (A1,A2,A3). The
length of this vector is found to be
|C | = (A1 - B1)2 + (A2 - B2)2 + (A3 - B3)2.
If q is the angle between the vectors A and B , the law of cosines is employed to write
|C |2 = | A|2 + |B|2 - 2| A||B| cos q.
Substitute into this relation the distances of the directed line segments for the magnitudes
of A, B and C . Expanding the resulting equation shows that the law of
cosines takes on the form
(A1 - B1)2 + (A2 - B2)2 + (A3 - B3)2 = A21
+ A22
+ A23
+ B2
1 + B2
2 + B2
3 - 2| A||B| cos q.
With elementary algebra, this relation simplifies to the form
A1B1 + A2B2 + A3B3 = | A||B | cos q
which suggests the definition of a dot product as A · B = | A||B | cos q.
Example 6-3. If A = A1 ˆe1 + A2 ˆe2 + A3 ˆe3 is a given vector in component form,
then
A
· A = A21

and |A| = A21

cos a =

|A |

, cos g =

|A|
are the direction cosines of the vector A . The dot product
eA · eA = cos2 a + cos2 b + cos2 g = 1
shows that the sum of squares of the direction cosines is unity.13

Example 6-5. (The Schwarz inequality)
Show that for any two vectors A and B one can write the Schwarz inequality
| A · B |£| A | | B | the equality holding if A and B are colinear.
Solution If A and B are nonzero quantities, then |A · B | must be a positive quantity.
Consider a graph of the function
y = y(x) = | A + xB |2= (A + xB ) · (A + xB )
y(x) =A · A + xA · B + xB · A + x2B · B
y(x) = | B |2 x2 + 2(A · B )x+ | A |2= ax2 + bx + c
Note that if y(x) > 0 for all values of x, then this would imply the graph of y(x) must
not cross the x-axis. If y(x) did cross the x-axis, then the equation y(x) = 0 would
have the two roots
x =
-b ±
Ö
b2 - 4ac
2a
in which case the discriminant b2 - 4ac would be positive. If y(x) does not cross the
x-axis, then the discriminant would satisfy b2 - 4ac £ 0. Here b = 2(A · B ), a =| B |2
and c =| A |2 and the condition that the discriminant be less than or equal zero can
be expressed
b2 - 4ac = 4(A · B )2 - 4 | B |2 | A |2£ 0
or | A · B |£| A | | B |
an inequality known as the Schwarz inequality.
Example 6-6. The triangle inequality
Show that for two vectors A and Bthe inequality | A + B |£| A | + | B | must hold.
This inequality is known as the triangle
inequality and indicates that the length of
one side of a triangle is always less than the
sum of the lengths of the other two sides.
Solution To prove the triangle inequality one can use the Schwarz inequality from
the previous example. Observe that
| A + B |2= (A + B ) · (A + B ) = A · A + A · B + B · A + B · B15
or
| A + B |2=| A |2 +2(A · B )+ | B |2£| A |2 +2 | A · B | + | B |2 (6.19)
Using the Schwarz inequality | A · B |£| A || B | the equation (6.19) can be expressed
| A + B |2£| A |2 +2 | A | | B | + | B |2= (| A | + | B |)2 (6.20)
Taking the square root of both sides of the equation (6.20) gives the triangle inequality
| A + B |£| A | + | B | .
The Cross Product or Outer Product
The cross or outer product of two nonzero vectors A and B is denoted using the
notation A × B and represents the construction of a new vector C defined as
C
= A × B = |A||B | sin q ˆen, (6.21)
where q is the smaller angle between the two nonzero vectors
A
and B when their origins coincide, and ˆen is a unit vector
perpendicular to the plane containing the vectors A and B
when their origins are made to coincide. The direction of ˆen
is determined by the right-hand rule. Place the fingers of your
right-hand in the direction of A and rotate the fingers toward
the vector B , then the thumb of the right-hand points in the
direction C .
The vectors A, B , C then form a right-handed system.2 Note that the cross product
A
×B is a vector which will always be perpendicular to the vectors A and B , whenever
A
and B are linearly independent.
A special case of the above definition occurs when A × B = 0 and in this case one
can state that either q = 0, which implies the vectors A and B are parallel or A = 0
or B = 0.
Use the above definition of a cross product and show that the orthogonal
unit vectors ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3 satisfy the relations
ˆe1 × ˆe1 = 0
ˆe1 × ˆe2 = ˆe3
ˆe1 × ˆe3 = -ˆe2
ˆe2 × ˆe1 = -ˆe3
ˆe2 × ˆe2 = 0
ˆe2 × ˆe3 = ˆe1
ˆe3 × ˆe1 = ˆe2
ˆe3 × ˆe2 = -ˆe1
ˆe3 × ˆe3 =0
(6.22)
2 Note many European technical books use left-handed coordinate systems which produces results different from
using a right-handed coordinate system.16
Properties of the Cross Product
A
× B = -B × A (noncommutative)
A
× (B + C ) = A × B + A × C (distributive law)
m(A × B ) = (mA) × B = A × (mB ) m a scalar
A
× A = 0 since A is parallel to itself.
Let A = A1 ˆe1 + A2 ˆe2 + A3 ˆe3 and B = B1 ˆe1 + B2 ˆe2 + B3 ˆe3 be two nonzero vectors
in component form and form the cross product A × B to obtain
A
× B = (A1 ˆe1 + A2 ˆe2 + A3 ˆe3) × (B1 ˆe1 + B2 ˆe2 + B3 ˆe3). (6.23)
The cross product can be expanded by using the distributive law to obtain
A
× B = A1B1 ˆe1 × ˆe1 + A1B2 ˆe1 × ˆe2 + A1B3 ˆe1 × ˆe3
+ A2B1 ˆe2 × ˆe1 + A2B2 ˆe2 × ˆe2 + A2B3 ˆe2 × ˆe3
+ A3B1 ˆe3 × ˆe1 + A3B2 ˆe3 × ˆe2 + A3B3 ˆe3 × ˆe3.
(6.24)
Simplification by using the previous results from equation (6.22) produces the important
cross product formula
A
× B = (A2B3 - A3B2) ˆe1 + (A3B1 - A1B3) ˆe2 + (A1B2 - A2B1) ˆe3, (6.25)
This result that can be expressed in the determinant form3

In summary, the cross product of two vectors A and B is a new vector C , where
C

Geometric Interpretation
A geometric interpretation that can be assigned to the magnitude of the cross
product of two vectors is illustrated in figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8. Parallelogram with sides A and B .
The area of the parallelogram having the vectors A and B for its sides is given
by
Area = |A | · h = |A||B | sin q = |A × B |. (6.28)
Therefore, the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors represents the area of
the parallelogram formed from these vectors when their origins are made to coincide.
Vector Identities
The following vector identities are often needed to simplify various equations in
science and engineering.
1. A × B = -B × A (6.29)
2. A · (B × C ) = B · (C × A) = C · (A× B ) (6.30)
An identity known as the triple scalar product.

4. A × (B × C ) = B(A · C ) - C (A · B ) (6.32)
The quantity A × (B × C ) is called a triple vector product.
5. (A × B ) · (C × D) = (A · C )(B · D ) - (A · D)(B · C ) (6.33)
6. The triple vector product satisfies
A
× (B × C ) + B × (C × A ) + C × (A × B ) = 0 (6.34)
Note that in the triple scalar product A · (B × C ) the parenthesis is sometimes
omitted because (A ·B )×C is meaningless and so A ·B ×C can have only one meaning.
The parenthesis just emphasizes this one meaning.18
A physical interpretation can be assigned to the triple scalar product A ·(B ×C ) is
that its absolute value represents the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three
noncoplaner vectors A , B , C when their origins are made to coincide. The absolute
value is needed because sometimes the triple scalar product is negative. This physical
interpretation can be obtained from the following analysis.
In figure 6-9 note the following.
(a) The magnitude |B × C | represents the area of the parallelogram PQRS.
(b) The unit vector ˆen =
B
× C
|B × C |
is normal to the plane containing the vectors B
and C .
Figure 6-9. Triple scalar product and volume.
(c) The dot product A · ˆen = A ·


A
· (B × C )

= |B × C | h = (Area of base)(Height) = Volume.
so that the magnitude of the triple scalar product is the volume of the parallelepiped
formed when the origins of the three vectors are made to coincide.
Example 6-7. Show that the triple scalar product satisfies the relations
A
· (B × C ) = B · (C × A) = C · (A × B )
Note the cyclic rotation of the symbols in the above relations where the first symbol
is moved to the last position and the second and third symbols are each moved to
the left. This is called a cyclic permutation of the symbols.18

Example 6-8. For nonzero vectors A , B , C show that the triple vector product
satisfies A × (B × C ) = (A × B ) × C
That is, the triple vector product is not associative and the order of execution of
the cross product is important.
Solution Let B × C = D denote the vector
perpendicular to the plane determined by the
vectors B and C . The vector A × D = E is a
vector perpendicular to the plane determined by
the vectors A and D and therefore must lie in
the plane of the vectors B and C . One can then
say the vectors B , C and A ×(B × C ) are coplanar
and consequently there must exist scalars a and
b such that
A
× (B × C ) = aB + bC (6.35)
4 See chapter 10 for properties of determinants.20
In a similar fashion one can show that the vectors (A × B )× C , A and B are coplanar
so that there exists constants g and d such that
(A × B ) × C = gA + dB (6.36)
The equations (6.35) and (6.36) show that in general
A
× (B × C ) = (A × B ) × C
Example 6-9. Show that the triple vector product satisfies
A
× (B × C ) = (A · C ) B - (A · B ) C
Solution Use the results from the previous example showing there exists scalars a
and b such that
A
× (B × C ) = aB + bC (6.37)
Let B × C = D and write
A
× D = aB + bC (6.38)
Take the dot product of both sides of equation (6.38) with the vector A to obtain
the triple scalar product
A
· (A × D ) = a(A · B ) + b(A · C )
By the permutation properties of the triple scalar product one can write
A
· (A × D ) = A · (D × A ) = D · (A× A ) = 0 = a(A · B ) + b(A · C ) (6.39)
The above result holds because A × A = 0 and implies
a(A · B ) = -b(A · C ) or
a
A
· C
=
-b
A
· B
= l
where l is a scalar. This shows that the equation (6.37) can be expressed in the
form
A
× (B × C ) = l(A · C )B - l(A · B )C (6.40)
which shows that the vectors A × (B × C ) and (A · C )B - (A · B )C are colinear. The
equation (6.40) must hold for all vectors A , B , C and so it must be true in the special
case A = ˆe2, B = ˆe1, C = ˆe2 where equation (6.40) reduces to
ˆe2 × ( ˆe1 × ˆe2) = ˆe1 = l ˆe1 which implies l = 121
Example 6-10.
Derive the law of sines for the triangle illustrated in the figure 6-10.
Solution The sides of the given triangle are formed from the vectors A , B and C and
since these vectors are free vectors they can be moved to the positions illustrated
in figure 6-10. Also sketch the vector -C as illustrated. The new positions for
the vectors A , B , C and -C are constructed to better visualize certain vector cross
products associated with the law of sines.
Figure 6-10. Triangle for law of sines.
Examine figure 6-10 and note the following cross products
C
× A = (A - B ) × A = A × A- B × A = -B × A = A × B
and B × (-C ) = B × (-A + B ) = B × (-A) + B × B = A × B .
Taking the magnitude of the above cross products gives
|C × A| = |A × B | = |B × (-C )|
or
AC sin qB = AB sin qC = BC sin qA.
Dividing by the product of the vector magnitudes ABC produces the law of sines

Solution Let C = A - B so that the dot product of C with itself gives
C
· C = (A - B ) · (A - B ) = A · A + B · B - 2A · B
or
C2 = A2 + B2 - 2AB cos q,
where A = |A |, B = |B |, C = |C | represent the magnitudes of the vector sides.
Example 6-12. Find the vector equation of the line which passes through the
two points P1(x1, y1, z1) and P2(x2, y2, z2).
Solution Let
r1 =x1 ˆe1 + x2 ˆe2 + x3 ˆe3
and r2 =x2 ˆe1 + y2 ˆe2 + z2 ˆe3
denote position vectors to the points P1 and P2
respectively and let r = x ˆe1+y ˆe2+z ˆe3 denote the
position vector of any other variable point on the
line. Observe that the vector r2 - r1 is parallel
to the line through the points P1 and P2. By vector addition the (x, y, z) position on
the line is given by
r = r1 + l(r2 -r1) -¥ < l < ¥ (6.41)23
where l is a scalar parameter. Note that as l varies from 0 to 1 the position vector
r moves from r1 to r2. An alternative form for the equation of the line is given by
r = r2 + l*(r1 -r2) -¥ < l* < ¥
where l* is some other scalar parameter. This second form for the line has the
position vector r moving from r2 to r1 as l* varies from 0 to 1. The vector ±(r2 -r1)
is called the direction vector of the line. Equating the coefficients of the unit vectors
in the equation (6.41) there results the scalar parametric equations representing the
line. These parametric equations have the form
x = x1 + l(x2 - x1), y = y1 + l(y2 - y1), z = z1 + l(z1 - z2) -¥ < l < ¥
If the quantities x2 -x1, y2 - y1 and z2 -z1 are different from zero, then the equation
for the line can be represented in the symmetric form
x - x1
x2 - x1
=
y - y1
y2 - y1
=
z - z1
z2 - z1
= l (6.42)
Note that the equation of a line can also be represented as the intersection of
two planes
N1x + N2y + N3z + D1 =0
M1x +M2y +M3z + D2 =0
or
N
· (r -r0) =0
M
· (r -r1) =0
provided the planes are not parallel or N = k M, for k a nonzero constant.
Example 6-13. Show the perpendicular distance from a point (x0, y0, z0) to a
given line defined by x = x1 + a1t, y = y1 + a2t, z = z1 + a3t is given by

(r0 -r1) ×
a
|a|

where a = a1 ˆe1 + a2 ˆe2 + a3 ˆe3
Solution The vector equation of the line is
r = r1 +a t, where (x1, y1, z1) is a point on the line
described by the position vector r1 and a is the
direction vector of the line. The vector r0 - r1
is a vector pointing from (x1, y1, z1) to the point
(x0, y0, z0). These vectors are illustrated in the
accompanying figure.24
Define the unit vector ˆea = 1
|a| a and construct the line from (x0, y0, z0) which is
perpendicular to the given line and label this distance d. Our problem is to find the
distance d. From the geometry of the right triangle with sides r0 -r1 and d one can
write sin q =
d
|r0 - r1|
. Use the fact that by definition of a cross product one can write
|(r0 -r1) × ˆea| = |r0 -r1|| ˆea| sin q = d =

Solution Let r1 = x1 ˆe1 + y1 ˆe2 + z1 ˆe3 denote the
position vector to the point P1 and let the vector
r = x ˆe1 +y ˆe2 +z ˆe3 denote the position vector
to any variable point (x, y, z) in the plane. If the
vector r - r1 lies in the plane, then it must be
perpendicular to the given vector N and consequently
the dot product of (r -r1) with N must
be zero and so one can write
(r -r1) · N = 0 (6.43)
as the equation representing the plane. In scalar form, the equation of the plane is
given as
(x - x1)N1 + (y - y1)N2 + (z - z1)N3 = 0 (6.44)
Example 6-15. Find the perpendicular distance d from a given plane
(x - x1)N1 + (y - y1)N2 + (z - z1)N3 = 0
to a given point (x0, y0, z0).
Solution Let the vector r0 = x0 ˆe1 + y0 ˆe2 + z0 ˆe3 point to the given point (x0, y0, z0)
and the vector r1 = x1 ˆe1 + y1 ˆe2 + z1 ˆe3 point the point (x1, y1, z1) lying in the plane.25
Construct the vector r0 -r1 which points from the terminus of r1 to the terminus of
r0 and construct the unit normal to the plane which is given by
ˆeN =
N1ˆe1 + N2 ˆe2 + N3 ˆe3
N2
1 + N2
2 + N2
3
Observe that the dot product ˆeN · (r0 - r1)
equals the projection of r0 - r1 onto ˆeN. This
gives the distance
d = | ˆeN · (r0 -r1)| =


where the absolute value signs guarantee that the
sign of d is always positive and does not depend
upon the direction selected for the unit vector ˆeN.
Moment Produced by a Force
The moment of a force with respect to a line is a measure of the forces tendency
to produce a rotation about the line. Let a force F acting at the point (x1, y1, z1)
be resolved into components parallel to the coordinate axes by expressing F in the
component form
F
= F1 ˆe1 + F2 ˆe2 + F3 ˆe3
That component of the force which is parallel to an axis has no tendency to produce a
rotation about that axis. For example, the F1 component is parallel to the x-axis and
does not produce a rotation about this axis. For a chosen axis, the moment about
that axis is the product of the force component times the perpendicular distance of
the force from the axis. By using the right-hand screw rule, one can assign a negative
sign to the moment if it acts clockwise and a positive sign to the moment if it acts
counterclockwise. The moment of a force is a vector quantity which produces a
definite sense of rotation about an axis.
With the use of figure 6-12 let us calculate the moment of a force F , acting at
the point (x1, y1, z1), about the x-, y- and z-axes.
(a) For the moment about the x-axis produces
F1 component parallel to x-axis does not produce moment
(Force)(^ distance) = +F3y1 (Counterclockwise rotation)
(Force)(^ distance) = -F2z1 (Clockwise rotation)26
The total moment about the x-axis is therefore the sum of these moments and
given by
M1 = F3y1 - F2z1.
(b) For the moment about the y-axis, one finds
(Force)(^ distance) = +F1z1 (Counterclockwise rotation)
F2 component parallel to the y-axis does not produce a moment
(Force)(^ distance) = -F3x1 (Clockwise rotation)
The total moment about the y-axis is therefore
M2 = F1z1 - F3x1.
Figure 6-12. Moments produced by a force F = F1 ˆe1 + F2 ˆe2 + F3 ˆe3
(c) For the moment about the z-axis show that
(Force)(^ distance) = -F1y1 (Clockwise rotation)
(Force)(^ distance) = +F2x1 (Counterclockwise rotation)
F3 component parallel to the z-axis does not produce a moment
The total moment about the z-axis is given by
M3 = F2x1 - F1y1.27
The total moment about the origin is a vector quantity represented as the vector
sum of the above moments in the form
M
0 = M1 ˆe1 +M2 ˆe2 +M3 ˆe3
= (F3y1 - F2z1) ˆe1 + (F1z1 - F3x1) ˆe2 + (F2x1 - F1y1) ˆe3.
(6.45)
If r1 = x1 ˆe1 +y1 ˆe2 +z1 ˆe3 is the position vector from the origin to the point (x1, y1, z1),
then the moment about the origin produced by the force F can be expressed as a
cross product of the vectors r1 and F and written as
M
0 = r1 × F =

ˆe1 ˆe2 ˆe3
x1 y1 z1
F1 F2 F3

. (6.46)
This is readily verified by expanding the equation (6.46) and showing the result is
given by equation (6.45).
Moment About Arbitrary Line
Assume one has a force F acting through a
given point A and rA is the position from the
origin to the point A. The moment about the
origin is given by M 0 = rA × F . The moment of
the given force Fabout the lines representing the
x, y and z axes are given by the projections of M 0
on each of these axes. One finds these moments
M0
·
ˆ
e1 =
M1, M
0 · ˆe2 = M2, M 0 · ˆe3 = M3
To find the moment about a given line L, choose any point B on the line L
and construct the position vector rB from the origin to the point B. The vector
rA - rB then points from point B to the force F acting at point A as illustrated in
the previous figure.
The moment of the force F about the point B is given by
M
B = (rA - rB) × F
Observe that this equation for M B represents a position vector from point B to
the force F crossed with F and has the exact same form as equation (6.46). The
only difference being where the position vector to the force F is constructed. The28
moment about the line L is then the projection of the vector moment MB on this
line. If ˆeL is a unit vector along the line, then M B · ˆeL represents the projection of
M
B on L. The direction of the unit vector ˆeL on the line L can point in one of two
directions (i.e. ˆeL or -ˆeL). However, once the direction of ˆeL has been chosen one
must be careful to analyze the dot product MB · ˆeL as its algebraic sign determines
the rotation sense produced by the moment (i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise).
A resultant force is the algebraic sum of the forces associated with a system.
The moment of a resultant force with respect to some axis is equal to the algebraic
sum of the moments of the system forces with respect to the same axis.
Example 6-16. If F = F1 ˆe1 + F2 ˆe2 + F3 ˆe3 is a force acting at the end of the
position vector r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3 then the moment of the force about the origin is
M
= r × F = (yF3-zF2) ˆe1+(zF1-xF3) ˆe2+(xF2-yF1) ˆe3. Make note that the moments
of the force components are
M
1 =r × (F1 ˆe1) = (x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3) × (F1 ˆe1) = -yF1 ˆe3 + zF1 ˆe2
M
2 =r × (F2 ˆe2) = (x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3) × (F2 ˆe2) = xF2 ˆe3 - zF2 ˆe1
M
3 =r × (F3 ˆe3) = (x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3) × (F3 ˆe3) = -xF3 ˆe2 + yF3 ˆe1
so that M = M 1 + M 2 + M 3
Differentiation of Vectors
Let us define what is meant by a derivative associated with a vector and consider
some applications of these derivatives. Again notation plays an important part in
the representation of the derivatives and therefore many examples are given to help
clarify concepts as they arise.
The equation of a space curve can be described in terms of a position vector from
the origin of a chosen coordinate system. For example, in cartesian coordinates the
position vector of a space curve can have the form
r = r(t) = x(t) ˆe1 + y(t) ˆe2 + z(t) ˆe3, (6.47)
where the space curve is defined by the parametric equations
x = x(t), y = y(t), z = z(t). (6.48)29
where t represents some convenient parameter, say time. The derivative of the
position vector r with respect to the parameter t is defined as
dr
dt
= lim
Dt®0
Dr
Dt
= lim
Dt®0
r(t + Dt) -r(t)
Dt
(6.49)
In component form the derivative is represented in a form where one can recognize
the previous definition of a derivative of a scalar function. One finds
dr
dt
= lim
Dt®0
[x(t + Dt) ˆe1 + y(t +Dt) ˆe2 + z(t + Dt) ˆe3] - [x(t) ˆe1 + y(t) ˆe2 + z(t) ˆe3]

dy

ˆe2 +
dz

ˆe3 = x(t) ˆe1 + y(t) ˆe2 + z(t) ˆe3
This shows that the derivative of the position vector (6.47) is obtained by differentiating
each component of the vector. It will be shown that this derivative represents
a vector tangent to the space curve at the point (x(t), y(t), z(t)) for any fixed value of
the parameter t. Second-order and higher order derivatives are defined as derivatives
of derivatives.
Example 6-17.
The two dimensional curve y = f(x) can be
represented by the position vector
r = r(x) = x ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2
with the derivative
dr
dx
= ˆe1 +
df
dx
ˆe2 = ˆe1 +
dy
dx
ˆe2
Note that at the point (x, f(x)) on the curve one can draw the derivative vector and
show that it lies along the tangent line to the curve at the point (x, f(x)). This shows
that the derivative dr
dx is a tangent vector to the curve y = f(x).
In general, if r = r(t) is the position vector of a three dimensional curve, then the
vector dr
dt will be a tangent vector to the curve. This can be illustrated by drawing
the secant line through the points r(t) and r(t+Dt) and showing the secant line then
approaches the tangent line as Dt approaches zero.30
Example 6-18.
Consider the space curve defined by the position
vector
r = r(t) = cos t ˆe1 + sin t ˆe2 + t ˆe3.
This curve sweeps out a spiral called a helix5.
The projection of the position vector r on the
plane z = 0 generates a circle with unit radius
about the origin.
The first and second derivatives of the position vector with respect to the parameter
t are
dr
dt
= -sint ˆe1 + cos t ˆe2 + ˆe3
d2r
dt2 = -cos t ˆe1 - sin t ˆe2.
The vector dr
dt is tangent to the curve at the point (cos t, sin t, t) for any fixed value of
the parameter t.
Tangent Vector to Curve
Let s denote the distance along a curve measured
from some fixed point on the curve and let
the position vector of a point P on the curve be
represented as a function of this distance. If the
position vector is given by
r = r(s) = x(s) ˆe1 + y(s) ˆe2 + z(s) ˆe3
then the derivative with respect to arc length s
is defined
dr

This limiting statement can be interpreted by the illustration above with the vector
r(s) pointing to some point P and the vector r(s + Ds) pointing to some near point
5 The given equation sweeps out a right-handed helix. Can you determine the equation for a left-handed helix?30
Example 6-18.

Tangent Vector to Curve
Let s denote the distance along a curve measured
from some fixed point on the curve and let
the position vector of a point P on the curve be
represented as a function of this distance. If the
position vector is given by

Q and the vector Dr representing the direction of the secant line through the points
P and Q.
Letting the point Q approach the point P one finds the direction of the secant
line vector Dr approaches the direction of the tangent to the curve at the point P.

since an element of arc length is given by ds2 = dx2+dy2 +dz2. This shows the vector

is a unit vector which is tangent to the space curve r = r(s).
By using chain rule differentiation one can assign a geometric interpretation
to the derivative of a space curve r = r(t) which is expressed in terms of a time
parameter t. Using the chain rule one finds

dt is a scalar called speed and represents the change in distance with respect
to time. The above equation shows the velocity vector is also tangent to the curve
at any instant of time.

The derivative of any vector v = v(t) is defined lim

. Note
the derivative of a constant vector is zero. Using the property that the limit of a
sum is the sum of the limits, the above differentiation formula indicates that each
of the components of a vector must be differentiated. Here it is assumed the unit
vectors ˆe1, ˆe1, ˆe3 are fixed constants and so their derivatives are zero.
For vector functions of the parameter t
u = u(t) = u1(t) ˆe1 + u2(t) ˆe2 + u3(t) ˆe3
v = v(t) = v1(t) ˆe1 + v2(t) ˆe2 + v3(t) ˆe3,
w = w(t) = w1(t) ˆe1 + w2(t) ˆe2 + w3(t) ˆe332
where the components ui(t) ,vi(t) and wi(t), i = 1, 2, 3 are continuous and differentiable,
the following differentiation rules can be verified using the definition of a derivative
as given by equation (6.49).

Kinematics of Linear Motion
In the study of dynamics or physics one encounters Newton’s three laws of
motion. These three laws are sometimes expressed in the following form.
1. A body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion remains in motion, unless
acted upon by an external force.
2. The time rate of change of the linear momentum of a body is proportional to
the force acting on the body, with the body moving in the direction of the applied
force.
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.33
If r represents the length and direction of a line drawn to the center of mass of a
body, then
dr
dt
= v represents the instantaneous velocity of the body and |v| = v =

dr
dt

represents the speed of the body. Let m denote the scalar mass of the body and let
w denote the vector weight of the body. Here weight is a force given by w = mg,
where g is the acceleration of gravity6 Denote by mv the linear momentum of the
body and let F denote the force acting on a body. Using these symbols Newton’s
second law can be expressed in the form
d
dt
(mv) = k F
and if the mass m is a constant, then m
dv
dt
= kF or ma = k F where k is a proportionality
constant and a =
dv
dt
denotes the acceleration of the body. The value of the
constant k depends upon the units used to measure distance, time and force.
The following is a set of units for force, mass, distance and time which allow
for the proportionality constant to have the value k = 1. The notation of brackets
around a quantity is used to denote “the dimensions of” the quantity. For example,
the notation, [y] = meters, is read, ”The dimension of y is meters.7
(fps) System
In the foot (ft), pound (lb), second (sec) system of measurements, one uses
[distance] = ft, [mass] = lb, [time] = sec, [Force] = slugs
where 1 slug · ft/sec2 = 1 lb force
(cgs) System
In the centimeter (cm), gram (g), second (sec) system of measurements, one uses
[distance] = cm, [mass] = g, [time] = sec, [Force] = dynes
where 1 dyne = 1 g · m/sec2
(mks) System
In the meter (m), kilogram (kg), second (sec) system of measurements, one uses
[distance] = m, [mass] = kg, [time] = sec, [Force] = N
where 1 N = 1 Newton = 1 kg · m/sec2
6 The magnitude of the acceleration of gravity g varies between 9.78
m
sec2 and 9.82
m
sec2 and depends upon
the position of latitude of the body. In this introduction, all particles and bodies are assumed to accelerate in a
gravitational field at the same rate with a value of g=32

Example 6-19.
A cannon ball of mass m is fired from a cannon with
an initial velocity v0 inclined at an angle q with the
horizontal as illustrated. Neglect air resistance and
find the equations of motion, maximum height, and
range of the cannon ball.
Solution: Let y = y(t) denote the vertical height at any time t and let x = x(t) denote
the horizontal distance at any time t. Consider the cannon ball at a position (x, y)
and examine the forces acting on it. In the y-direction the force due to the weight of
the cannon ball is W = mg, (g = 32 ft/sec2). The equation of motion in the y-direction
is represented as
m
d2y
dt2 = -W = -mg. (6.50)
Forces in the x-direction like air resistance are neglected. Newton’s second law can
then be expressed
m
d2x
dt2 = 0. (6.51)
Make note of the fact that whenever time t is the independent variable, the dot
notation
x? =
dx
dt
, ¨x =
d2x
dt2 , y? =
dy
dt
, ¨y =
d2y
dt2 (6.52)
is often employed to denote derivatives. Using the dot notation the equations (6.50)
and (6.51) would be represented
¨y = -g and ¨x = 0 (6.53)
Calculating the x and y-components of the initial velocity, the equations (6.50)
and (6.51) are solved subject to the initial conditions:
x(0) = 0, y(0) = 0
x? (0) = v0 cos q, y?(0) = v0 sin q,
where v0 is the initial speed and q is the angle of inclination of the cannon. Solving
the differential equations (6.50) and (6.51) by successive integrations gives
y? = - gt + c1,
y = - g
t2
2
+ c1t + c2,
x? =c3
x =c3t + c435
where c1, c2, c3, c4 are constants of integration. The solution satisfying the initial
conditions can be expressed as
y = y(t) = -
g
2
t2 + (v0 sin q) t
x = x(t) = (v0 cos q) t.
(6.54)
These are parametric equations describing the position of the cannon ball. The
position vector describing the path of the cannon ball is given by
r = r(t) = (v0 cos q) t ˆe1 + (-
g
2
t2 + (v0 sin q) t) ˆe2
The maximum height occurs where the derivative dy
dt is zero, and the maximum range
occurs when the height y returns to zero at some time t > 0. The derivative dy
dt is zero
when t has the value t1 = v0 sin q/g, and at this time,
ymax = y(t1) =
v2
0 sin2 q
2g
, x = x(t1) =
v2
0 sin 2q
2g
(6.55)
The maximum range occurs when y = 0 at time t2 = 2
v0 sin q
g
, and at this time,
xmax = x(t2) =
v2
0 sin 2q
g
.
Eliminating t from the parametric equations (6.54), demonstrates that the trajectory
of the cannon ball is a parabola.
Example 6-20. (Circular motion)
Consider a particle moving on a circle of radius r with a constant angular velocity
	 = dq

Assume the position of the particle at any given time t is given by the position
vector
r = r(t) = r cos	t ˆe1 + r sin 	t ˆe2 r and 	 are constants.
The displacement of the particle as it moves around the circle is given by s = rq and
the speed of the particle is

The velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector r since v · r = 0 as can
be readily verified. The velocity vector is a free vector and can be moved anywhere36
and so it is placed at the end of the position vector, as illustrated in the figure 6-13
to show that the velocity is tangent to the circle. The magnitude of the velocity v
is the speed v given by
|v| = v =

r2	2 sin2 	t + r2	2 cos2 	t = r	
One can define an angular velocity vector 	 as follows. Use the right-hand rule
and point the fingers of your right-hand in the direction of the position vector r
and then rotate your fingers in the direction of motion of the particle. Your thumb
then points in the direction of the angular velocity vector. For circular motion
counterclockwise in the x, y-plane, one can define the angular velocity vector 	 = 	 ˆe3.
By defining an angular velocity vector one can express the velocity vector of a
rotating particle by
v = 	 ×r =

ˆe1 ˆe2 ˆe3
0 0 	
r cos q r sin q 0

= ˆe1 (-	r sin q) - ˆe2 (-	r cos q) , q = 	t (6.57)
and this equation can be compared with equation (6.56).
The acceleration of the rotating particle is given by
a =
dv
dt
= -r	2 cos 	t ˆe1 - r	2 sin 	t ˆe2 = -	2r
This shows the acceleration is directed toward the origin. It is therefore called a
centripetal acceleration.8 The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is
|a| = 	2r =
v2
r
= v	
The acceleration can also be obtained by differentiating the vector velocity given by
equation (6.57) to obtain
a =
dv
dt
= 	 ×
dr
dt
+
d	
dt
× r
and since 	 is a constant, then dw
dt = 0 so that the above reduces to
a = 	 ×
dr
dt
= 	 ×v = 	 × (	 ×r) = -	2r
8 Centripetal means “center-seeking”.37
where the last simplification was obtained using the vector identity given by equation
(6.32) and the result 	 · r = 0. The above results are derived under the assumption
that the angular velocity 	 = dq
dt was a constant.
Figure 6-13. Particle moving in circular motion.
In contrast, let us examine what happens if the angular velocity is not a constant.
The position vector to a particle undergoing circular motion is given by
r = r cos q ˆe1 + r sin q ˆe2
where q = q(t) is the angular displacement as a function of time. The velocity of the
particle is given by
v =

velocity as
v = -r	(t) sinq ˆe1 + r	(t) cos q ˆe2

is the angular acceleration. The acceleration vector can be
broken up into two components by writing
a = -r	2 [cos q ˆe1 + sin q ˆe2] + ra [-sin q ˆe1 + cos q ˆe2]38
The physical interpretation applied to the acceleration vector is as follows. Observe
that the vectors
ˆer = cos q ˆe1 + sin q ˆe2 and ˆeq = -sin q ˆe1 + cos q ˆe2
are unit vectors and that these vectors are perpendicular to one another since they
satisfy the dot product relation ˆer · ˆeq = 0. The vectors ˆer and ˆeq represent unit
vectors in polar coordinates and are illustrated in the figure 6-13. The acceleration
vector can then be expressed in the form
a = -r	2 ˆer + ra ˆeq = ar +at
where ar = -r	2 ˆer is called the radial component of the acceleration or centripetal
acceleration and at = ra ˆeq is called the tangential component of the acceleration.
These components have the magnitudes
|ar| = r	2 and |at| = ra
Note that if 	 is a constant, then a = 0 and consequently the tangential component of
the acceleration will always be zero leaving only the radial component of acceleration.
Example 6-21. Transverse and Radial Components of Velocity
Consider the motion of a particle which is
described in polar coordinates by an equation
of the form r = f(q), where q is measured in
radians. Select a point P with coordinates (r, q)
on the curve and construct the radius vector r
from the origin to the point P. Construct the
tangent to the curve at the point P and define
the angle 
 between the radius vector and the
tangent. Label a fixed point on the curve, say
the fixed point x0 where the curve intersects the x-axis. Let s denote the arc length
along the curve measured from x0 to the point P. The velocity of the particle P as
it moves along the curve is given by the change in distance with respect to time t
and can be written v =
ds
dt
.39
The velocity vector is in the direction of the tangent to the curve and the component
of the velocity along the direction 0P is called the radial component of the
velocity and denoted vr. At the point P construct a line perpendicular to the line
segment 0P, then the component of the velocity projected onto this perpendicular
line segment is called the transverse component of the velocity and denoted by vq.
These projections of the velocity vector give the radial and transverse components
vr = v cos
 and vq = v sin 

where v =
ds
dt
=

v2
r + v2
q is the magnitude of the velocity called the speed of the
particle. The unit tangent vector to the curve is given by
ˆet = cos
 ˆer + sin
 ˆeq
where ˆer is a unit vector in the radial direction and ˆeq is a unit vector in the
transverse direction. The derivative of the position vector with respect to the time
t can be written as
dr
dt
=
dr
ds
ds
dt
= v ˆet = v cos 
 ˆer + v sin 
 ˆeq = vr ˆer + vq ˆeq
Therefore, when the position vector to the point P is written in the form
r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 or r = r cos q ˆe1 + r sin q ˆe2 = r ˆer
where ˆer is the unit vector in the radial direction given by ˆer = cos q ˆe1 + sin q ˆe2, one
finds the derivative of this unit vector with respect to q produces the vector
d ˆer
dq
= ˆeq = -sin q ˆe1 + cos q ˆe2
The derivative of the position vector with respect to arc length is a unit vector so
that

Note also that if dq

Example 6-22. Angular Momentum
Recall that a moment causes a rotational motion. Let us investigate what happens
when Newton’s second law is applied to rotational motion. The angular momentum
of a particle is defined as the moment of the linear momentum. Let H denote
the angular momentum; mv, the linear momentum; and r, the position vector of the
particle, then by definition the moment of the linear momentum is expressed
H
= r × (mv) = r ×

Observe that the second cross product term is zero because the vectors are parallel.
Also note that by using Newton’s second law, involving a constant mass, one can
write
F = ma = m
dv
dt
= m
d2r
dt2 .41
Comparing these last two equations it is found that the time rate of change of
angular momentum is expressible in terms of the force F acting upon the particle.
In particular, one can write
dH
dt
= r × F = M .
One of the many marvelous things introduced by the early Greek mathematicians
was that symbols represent ideas and concepts. The symbols in our last equation
tell us about a fundamental principal in Newtonian dynamics, that the time rate
of change of angular momentum equals the moment of the force acting on the
particle.
Angular Velocity
A rigid body is one where any two distinct points remain a constant distance
apart for all time. A rigid body in motion can be studied by considering both
translational and rotational motion of the points within the body. Assume there
is no translational motion but only rotational motion of the rigid body. A simple
rotation of every point in the rigid body, about a line through the body, can be
described by (a) an axis of rotation L and (b) an angular velocity vector 	. If the
axis of rotation remains fixed in space, then all points in the rigid body must move
in circular arcs about the line L. Consider a point P revolving about L in a circular
path of radius a as illustrated in figure 6-14.
The average angular speed of the point P is given by D
Dt , where D is the angle
swept out by P in a time interval Dt. The instantaneous angular speed is a scalar
quantity 	 determined by
	 =
d
dt
= lim
Dt®0
D
Dt
.
There is a direction associated with the angular motion of P about the line L and
thus an angular velocity vector 	 is introduced and defined so that
(i) 	 has a magnitude or length equal to the angular speed 	,
(ii) 	 is perpendicular to the plane of the circular path.
(iii) The direction of 	 is in the direction of advance of a right-hand screw when turned
in the direction of rotation.
Choose any point O on the line L and construct the position vector r from O to
an arbitrary point P inside the rigid body. The arc length s swept out as P moves42
through the angle  is given by s = a. The magnitude of the linear speed v, of the
point P, is given by
v =
ds
dt
= a
d
dt
= a	 = |v|.
Figure 6-14. Rotation of a rigid body about a line.
The geometry in figure 6-14, is investigated and indicates that a = |r| sin q, and
hence the magnitude of the velocity can be represented as
ds
dt
= |v| = |	||r| sin q.
The velocity vector is always normal to the plane containing the position vector and
the angular velocity vector. Therefore the velocity vector can be expressed as
dr
dt
= v = 	 ×r = |	||r| sin q ˆen,
where ˆen is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing the vectors 	 and r.
The above arguments demonstrate that the expression for the velocity of a rotating
vector is independent of the orientation of the cartesian x-,y-,z-axes as long as the
origin of the coordinate system lies on the axis of rotation. To prove this result let
O denote the origin of some new x, y, z cartesian reference frame with its origin on
the axis of rotation. If r1 is the position vector from this origin to the same point P
considered earlier, one finds that
dr1
dt
= v1 = 	 ×r1.43
It therefore remains to show that v1 = v. The geometry of figure 6-14, provides an
aid in demonstrating that the vectors r1 and r are related by the vector equation
r1 = A +r,
where A is a vector from the origin of one system to the origin of the other system
and lying along the axis of rotation and in the same direction as 	. These results
demonstrate that 	 × A =0 and
dr1
dt
= v1 = 	 × r1 = 	 × (A +r) = 	 × A + 	 × r = 	 ×r = v =
dr
dt
,
Here the distributive law for cross products has been employed and the fact that
both 	 and A have the same direction produced a cross product of zero.
Let B denote any vector connecting two fixed
points within a rigid body which is rotating about
a line with angular velocity 	. Let r1 denote a
vector to the terminus of B and let r2 denote a
vector to the origin of B , as measured from some
origin on the axis of rotation. One can then write
dr1
dt
= 	 × r1 and
dr2
dt
= 	 ×r2
Observe that by vector addition r2 + B = r1 so that
dB
dt
=
dr1
dt
-
dr2
dt
= 	 × r1 - 	 ×r2 = 	 × (r1 -r2) = 	 × B
Therefore one can state that in general, if B is any fixed vector lying within a rigid
body which is rotating, then with respect to any origin on the axis of rotation, one
can state that
dB
dt
= 	 × B (6.59)
This is an important result used in the study of rotating bodies.
Two-Dimensional Curves
The graphical representation of a function y = f(x) in a rectangular cartesian
coordinate system can also be presented in a vector language. A graph of the
function y = f(x) can be represented by a position vector r, measured from the44
origin, which sweeps out the curve as the parameter x varies. In figure 6-15, the
position vector r is illustrated. This position vector has the representation
r = r(x) = x ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2. (6.60)
As the parameter x varies, the position vector r represents the distance and direction
of the point (x, f(x)) with respect to the origin. The derivative
dr
dx
= r (x) = ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2 (6.61)
is also illustrated in figure 6-15. Observe that the derivative represents the tangent
vector to the curve at the point (x, f(x)). There can be two tangent vectors to the
curve at (x, f(x)), namely
dr
dx
= r (x) and -
dr
dx
= -r (x). Unless otherwise stated, the
tangent vector in the sense of increasing parameter x is to be understood.
The cross product of the unit vector ˆe3, out of the plane of the curve, and the
tangent vector dr
dx = r (x) to the curve, gives a normal vector N to the curve at the
point (x, f(x)). One calculates this normal vector using the cross product
N

Note there can be two normal vectors to the curve at the point (x, f(x)), namely N
and -N . To verify that N is normal to the tangent vector at a general point (x, f(x))
one can examine the dot product of the normal and tangent vector N ·
dr
dx
and show
N
·
dr
dx
= [-f(x) ˆe1 + ˆe2] · [ ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2] = 0
which demonstrates these two vectors are perpendicular to one another. Further,
the magnitudes of the normal vector N and the tangent vector dr
dx are equal and can
be represented
|N | =

dr
dx

=

1 + [f(x)]2. (6.63)
One can use the magnitudes of the tangent and normal vectors to construct unit
vectors in the tangent and normal directions at each point (x, f(x)) on the plane
curve. One finds these unit vectors have the form
ˆet =
ˆe1 + f  (x) ˆe2
1 + [f(x)]2
and ˆen =
-f(x) ˆe1 + ˆe2

and the derivative of this arc length with respect to the parameter x is

which shows the unit tangent vector to the curve is the derivative of the position vector
with respect to arc length. The choice of the sign on the square root determines
the direction of the unit tangent vector.
At each point on the plane curve the unit tangent vector ˆet makes an angle q
with the constant unit vector ˆe1. The absolute value of the rate of change of this
angle with respect to arc length is called the curvature and is denoted by the Greek
letter . The curvature is thus represented by

When the dot product of two nonzero vectors is zero, the two vectors are perpendicular
to one another. Hence, the vector
d ˆet
ds
is perpendicular to the tangent vector ˆet
when evaluated at a common point on the curve. It is known that the vector ˆen is
perpendicular to the tangent vector. The vectors ˆen and
d ˆet
ds
are therefore colinear.
Consequently there exists a suitable constant c such that
d ˆet
ds
= c ˆen.
It is now demonstrated that c = , the curvature associated with the curve. To

The reciprocal of the curvature  is called the radius of curvature . Note that straight
lines have a constant angle q between a unit tangent vector and the x-axis and hence
the curvature of straight lines is zero since the curvature is a measure of how fast
the tangent vector is changing with respect to arc length.
To understand the meaning of the radius of curvature, consider the vectors N (x)
and N (x + Dx) which are normal to the curve y = f(x) at the points (x, f(x)) and
(x + Dx, f(x + Dx)). These vectors are illustrated in figure 6-15. For appropriate
scalars a and b, the vector equations
C
(x) = r(x) + aN (x) and C (x) = r(x + Dx) + b N (x +Dx)
depict the common point of intersection (h, k) of these normal lines to the plane
curve, provided these normal lines are not parallel. The scalars a and b are related
by the vector equation
r(x) + aN (x) = r(x +Dx) + b N (x + Dx). (6.69)
If in the limit as Dx ® 0, the point of intersection (h, k) approaches a specific value,
this limit point is called the center of curvature. To find the center of curvature
(h, k), the scalar a (or b) must be determined. This is accomplished by expanding
the above equations relating a and b. When the vector equation (6.69) is expanded,
one finds have
x ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2 - af(x) ˆe1 + a ˆe2 = (x +Dx) ˆe1 + f(x + Dx) ˆe2 - bf(x + Dx) ˆe1 + b ˆe2.
Equate like components the two scalar equations and show
x - af(x) - (x + Dx) + bf(x +Dx) = 0 and
f(x) + a - f(x +Dx) - b = 0.
(6.70)
By eliminating b from these two equations one finds
a

f(x + Dx) - f(x)
Dx
	
= 1 +

f(x + Dx) - f(x)
Dx
	
f(x + Dx). (6.71)
In this equation let Dx ® 0 and solve for a and find
a =
1 + [f(x)]2
f(x)
, f(x) = 0. (6.72)48
From this result the center of curvature is found to have the position vector
C
(x) = r(x) + aN (x) = x ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2 +
1 + [f(x)]2
f(x)
[-f(x) ˆe1 + ˆe2] . (6.73)
Note the position vector can also be expressed in the form
C
(x) = r(x) +  ˆen, where  =

and consequently the coordinates of the center of curvature can be determined.
These coordinates are given by
h = x -
f(x)
f(x)
(1 + [f(x)]2) and k = f(x) +
1
f(x)
(1 + [f(x)]2), (6.75)
provided that f(x) = 0. For f(x) = 0, there is a point of inflection, and the circle of
curvature degenerates into a straight line which is the tangent line to the point of
inflection of the curve. Consider the set of all circles which have their centers on
the normal line to the curve and which pass through the point where the normal
line intersects the curve (i.e., circles are tangent to the tangent vectors). Of all the
circles, there is only one which has a contact of the second order and this circle has
its center at the center of curvature (h, k). A contact of second order means that not
only does the circle and curve have a common point of intersection and a common
first derivative but also that they have a common second derivative. A proof of
these statements is now offered. Let the equation of the circle be denoted by
( - h)2 + ( - k)2 = 2, (6.76)
where the (, ) axes coincide with the (x, y) axes and h, k,  are the functions of x
derived above. If one considers x as being held constant and treats  as a function
of , then by differentiating the equation of the circle (6.76) twice one produces the
derivatives
( - h) + ( - k)
d
d
= 0 and 1 +

d
d
2
+ ( - k)
d2
d2 = 0 (6.77)
At the common point of intersection where (, ) = (x, f(x)) one finds
 - h =
f(x)
f(x)
(1 + [f(x)]2) and  - k = -
1
f(x)
(1 + [f(x)]2)49
so that
d

d2
d2 = -

 - k
= f(x)
This shows that the first and second derivatives at the common point of intersection
of the curve and circle are the same and so this intersection is called a contact of
order two.
Scalar and Vector Fields
Of extreme importance in science and engineering are the concepts of a scalar
field and a vector field.
Scalar and vector fields
Let R denote a region of space in a cartesian coordinate system.
If corresponding to each point (x, y, z) of the region R there
corresponds a scalar function f = f(x, y, z), then a scalar field is
said to exist over the region R. If to each point (x, y, z) of a region
R there corresponds a vector function
F
= F (x, y, z) = F1(x, y, z) ˆe1 + F2(x, y, z) ˆe2 + F3(x, y, z) ˆe3,
then a vector field is said to exist in the region R.
That is, a scalar field is a one-to-one correspondence between points in space and
scalar quantities and a vector field is a one-to-one correspondence between points in
space and vector quantities. The functions which occur in the representation of a
vector or scalar fields are assumed to be single valued, continuous, and differentiable
everywhere within their region of definition.
Example 6-23.
An example of a vector field is the velocity
of a fluid. In such a velocity field, at each point
in some specified region a velocity vector exists
which describes the fluid velocity. The velocity
vector is a function of position within the specified
region. Consider water flowing in a channel50
having a depth h as illustrated. Construct a set of x, y axes with y = 0 representing
the bottom of the channel and y = h representing the top of the channel. If
the velocity of the fluid in the channel is given by the one-dimensional vector field
v = ay ˆe1, for 0 £ y £ h and a is some proportionality constant, then the vector field
associated with this flow can be graphically illustrated by sketching the vectors v at
various depths in the channel. The resulting images represent one way of illustrating
a vector field. The resulting sketch is called a vector field plot.
Example 6-24.
Consider the two-dimensional vector field v = v(x, y) = y ˆe1 + x ˆe2. There are
computer programs that can graphically illustrate this vector field by plotting vectors
at selected points within a specified region. The resulting images of all the vectors
illustrated at a finite set of points is called a vector field plot. The figure 6-16
illustrates a vector field plot for the above vector v sketched at selected points over
the region R = {(x, y) | -5 £ x £ 5, -5 £ y £ 5 }.
An alternative method of illustrating a vector field is to define a set of curves,
called field lines, where each curve has the property that at each point (x, y) on any
curve, the tangent to the curve at (x, y) has the same direction as the vector field at
that point. If r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 is a position vector to a point (x, y) on a field line, then
dr gives the direction of the tangent line and if this direction is to have the same
direction as v, then the two directions must be proportional and requires that
dr = dx ˆe1 + dy ˆe2 = kv(x, y) = k [y ˆe1 + x ˆe2] = ky ˆe1 + kx ˆe2 (6.78)
where k is some proportionality constant.
Figure 6-16. Vector field plot for v = v(x, y) = y ˆe1 + x ˆe251
If these direction are the same, then by equating like components one must have
dx = ky and dy = kx or
dx
y
=
dy
x
= k (6.79)
The equation (6.79) requires that x dx = y dy and if one integrates both sides of this
equation one obtains the family of field lines
x2
2
-
y2
2
=
C
2
or x2 - y2 = C (6.80)
where C/2 is selected as the constant of integration to make all terms have a factor
of 2 in the denominator. Plotting these curves over the region R for various values
of the constant C gives the field lines illustrated in the figure 6-16. The final figure
in figure 6-16 illustrates the field lines atop the vector field plot in order that you
can get a comparison of the two techniques.
Example 6-25.
An example of a two-dimensional scalar field
is a scalar function  = (x, y) representing the
temperature at each point (x, y) inside some specified
region. The scalar field can be visualized by
plotting the family of curves (x, y) = C for various
values of the constant C.
The resulting family of curves are called level curves and represent curves where
the temperature has a constant value. If the scalar field  = (x, y) represented
height of the water above some reference point, then one can think of say an island
where at different times the level of the water makes a contour of the island shape.
In this case the family of curves (x, y) = C, for various values of the constant C,
are called level curves or contour plots since at various heights C the contour of the
island is given. Example contour plots are illustrated in figures 6-16 and 6-17.
Note that there are many computer programs capable of drawing contour plots
or level curves associated with a given scalar function. The figure 6-17 illustrates
contour plots or level curves for several different two-dimensional scalar functions as
the level C changes.52
Figure 6-17. Contour plots of selected two-dimensional scalar functions.
A vector field is a one–to–one correspondence between points in space and vector
quantities, whereas a scalar field is a one–to–one correspondence between points
in space and scalar quantities. The concept of scalar and vector fields has many
generalizations. A scalar field assigns a single number (x, y, z) to each point of space.
A two-dimensional vector field would assign two numbers (F1(x, y, z), F2(x, y, z)) to
each point of space, and a three-dimensional vector field would assign three numbers
(F1(x, y, z), F2(x, y, z), F3(x, y, z)) to each point of space. An immediate generalization
would be that an n-dimensional vector field would assign an n-tuple of numbers
(F1, F2, . . . , Fn) to each point of space. Here each component Fi is a function of
position, and one can write
Fi = Fi(x, y, z), i = 1, . . . , n.
Other immediate ideas that come to mind are the concepts of assigning n2 numbers
to each point in space or n3 numbers to each point in space. These higher dimensional
correspondences lead to the study of matrices and tensor fields which are functions
of position. In science and engineering, there is great interest in how such scalar
and vector fields change with position and time.
Partial Derivatives
If a vector field F = F (x, y, z) = F1(x, y, z) ˆe1+F2(x, y, z) ˆe2+F3(x, y, z) ˆe3 is referenced
with respect to a fixed set of cartesian axes, then the partial derivatives of this vector
field are given by:53
¶ F
¶x

¶F1
¶x
ˆe1 +
¶F2

(6.81)
Observe that each component of the vector field F must be differentiated.
The higher partial derivatives are defined as derivatives of derivatives. For example,
the second order partial derivatives are given by the expressions

, (6.82)
where each component of the vectors are differentiated. This is analogous to the
definitions of higher derivatives previously considered.

Notation
The position vector r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3 is sometimes represented in matrix notation
as a row vector r = (x, y, z) or a column vector r = col(x, y, z). Sometimes the
substitution x = x1, y = x2 and z = x3 is made and these vectors are represented as
x = (x1, x2, x3) or x = col(x1, x2, x3) and a vector function
F (x, y, z) = F1(x, y, z) ˆe1 + F2(x, y, z) ˆe2 + F3(x, y, z) ˆe3
is represented in the form of either a row vector or column vector
F (x) = (F1(x), F2(x), F3(x)) or F (x) = col(F1(x), F2(x), F3(x))
where the representation of the basis vectors ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3 is to be understood and col
is used to denote a column vector.
This change in notation is made in order that scalar and vector concepts can
be extended to represent scalars and vectors in higher dimensions. For example,
the representation x = (x1, x2, x2, . . . , xn) would represent an n-dimensional vector,
The scalar function  = (x) = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) would represent a scalar function
of n-variables and the vector F (x) = (F1(x), F2(x), . . . , Fn(x)) would represent an ndimensional
vector function of position.
Gradient, Divergence and Curl
The gradient of a scalar function  = (x, y, z) is the vector function
grad  =

¶x

¶
¶y
ˆe2 +
¶

If the scalar function is represented in the form  = (x1, x2, x3), then the gradient
vector is sometimes expressed in the form
grad  =

¶x2
,
¶

where it is to be understood that the partial derivatives are to be evaluated at the
point (x1, x2, x3) = (x, y, z). The vector operator
 =

¶x
ˆe1 +

called the “del operator”or “nabla”, is sometimes used to represent the gradient as
an operator operating upon a scalar function to produce

The divergence of a vector function F (x, y, z) is a scalar function defined by
div F =
¶F1
¶x

¶F2
¶y

Taylor Series for Vector Functions
Consider a vector function
F = F (x) = F (x1, x2) = F1(x1, x2) ˆe1 + F2(x1, x2) ˆe2
which is continuous and possesses (n + 1) partial derivatives. The Taylor series
expansion for this function is just applying the Taylor series expansion to each of
the scalar functions F1, F2. Associated with the vector h = (h1, h2) is the vector
operator
h ·  = h1
¶
¶x1

small vector displacement from the point x0, then the Taylor series expansion can
be written

In three dimensions vectors of the form
F = F (x) = F (x1, x2, x3) = F1(x1, x2, x3) ˆe1 + F2(x1, x2, x3) ˆe2 + F3(x1, x2, x3) ˆe3
which have (n+1) partial derivatives can be expanded in a Taylor series by expanding
each of the components in a Taylor series. Associated with the vector displacement

and find that the Taylor series expansion has the same form as equation (6.84)57
Differentiation of Composite Functions
Let  = (x, y, z) define a scalar field and consider a curve passing through the
region where the scalar field is defined. Express the curve through the scalar field
in the parametric form
x = x(t), y = y(t), z = z(t),
with parameter t. The value of the scalar , at the points (x, y, z) along the curve, is
a function of the coordinates on the curve. By substituting into  the position of a
general point on the curve, one can write
 = (x(t), y(t), z(t)).
By substituting the time-varying coordinates of the curve into the function , one
creates a composite function. The time rate of change of this composite function ,
as one moves along the curve, is derived from chain rule differentiation and

Integration of Vectors
Let u(s) = u1(s) ˆe1+u2(s) ˆe2+u3(s) ˆe3 denote a vector function of arc length, where
the components ui(s), i = 1, 2, 3 are continuous functions. The indefinite integral of
u(s) is defined as the indefinite integral of each component of the vector. This is
expressed in the form

(6.89)
where U (s) is a vector such that dU
ds = u(s) and C is a vector constant of integration.
The definite integral of u is defined as

If at time t = 0 the position and velocity of the particle are given by
r(0) = 6 ˆe1 - 3 ˆe2 + 4 ˆe3 and v(0) = 7 ˆe1 - 6 ˆe2 - 5 ˆe3,
find the position and velocity as a function of time.
Solution: An integration of the acceleration with respect to time produces the velocity
and 
a(t) dt = v = v(t) = -cos t ˆe1 + sin t ˆe2 +c1,
where c1 is a vector constant of integration. From the above initial condition for the
velocity, the constant c1 can be determined. One finds
v(0) = -ˆe1 +c1 = 7 ˆe1 - 6 ˆe2 - 5 ˆe3 or c1 = 8 ˆe1 - 6 ˆe2 - 5 ˆe3.
Consequently, the velocity can be expressed as a function of time in the form
v = v(t) =
dr
dt
= (-cos t + 8) ˆe1 + (sin t - 6) ˆe2 - 5 ˆe3.
An integration of the velocity with respect to time produces the position vector as
a function of time and

r(t) = (-sint + 8t) ˆe1 + (-cos t - 6t) ˆe2 - 5t ˆe3 +c2,
where c2 is a vector constant of integration. From the above initial conditions, at
time t = 0, one can determine this vector constant of integration and
r(0) = -ˆe2 +c2 = 6 ˆe1 - 3 ˆe2 + 4 ˆe3 or c2 = 6 ˆe1 - 2 ˆe2 + 4 ˆe3.
The position vector as a function of time can be expressed as
r = r(t) = (-sin t + 8t + 6) ˆe1 + (-cos t - 6t - 2) ˆe2 + (-5t + 4) ˆe3.60
Example 6-28. A particle in a force field F = F (x, y, z) having a position
vector r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3 moves according to Newton’s second law such that
F = ma = m

or F dt = mdv.
An integration over the time interval t1 to t2 produces
 t2

F dt = mv(t2) -mv(t1).
The quantity
 t2
t1
F dt is called the linear impulse on the particle over the time interval
(t1, t2). The quantity mv is called the linear momentum of the particle. The above
equation tells us that the linear impulse equals the change in linear momentum.
Example 6-29. In 10 seconds a particle with a mass of 1 gram changes velocity
from
v1 = 6 ˆe1 + 2 ˆe2 + 7 ˆe3 cm/s to v2 = -2 ˆe1 + ˆe3 cm/s.
What average force produces this change?
Solution: The average force over a time interval (t1, t2) is given by
F avg =

F dt.
But the integral

Line Integrals of Scalar and Vector Functions.
An important type of vector integration is integration by line integrals. Let C be a
curve defined by a position vector
r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3,61
where x, y, z define some parametric representation of the curve C. The element of
arc length along the curve, when squared, is given by
ds2 = dr · dr = dx2 + dy2 + dz2.
An integration (summation) produces the following formulas for the arc length s.
1. If y = y(x) and z = z(x) are known in terms of the parameter x, the arc length
between two points P0(x0, y0, z0) and P1(x1, y1, z1) on the curve can be represented
in the form
s =
 x1
x0

dy
dx
2

dz
dx
2
dx. (6.92)
2. If the parametric equations of the curve are given by x = x(t), y = y(t) and z = z(t),
the arc length between two points P0 and P1 on the curve is given by
s =
 t1
t0

dx
dt

where the parametric values t = t0 and t = t1 correspond to the points P0 and P1
and
x(t0) = x0, y(t0) = y0, z(t0) = z0
x(t1) = x1, y(t1) = y1, z(t1) = z1.
Figure 6-18. Curve C partitioned into n-segments between P0 and P1.
The above formulas result indirectly from the following limiting process. On
that part of the curve between the given points P0(x0, y0, z0) and P1(x1, y1, z1), the arc
length along the curve is divided into n segments by a set of numbers62
s0 < s1 < . . . < sn,
where corresponding to each value of the arc length parameter si there is a position
vector r(si) = x(si) ˆe1 + y(si) ˆe2 + z(si) ˆe3, for i = 1, . . . , n, as illustrated in figure 6-18.
A change in the element of arc length from r(si-1) to r(si) is defined as
Dsi = |r(si) -r(si-1)| = |Dri| .
The total arc length is obtained from the sum of these elements of arc length as
the number of these lengths increase without bound and the partition gets finer and
finer. In symbols, this limit is denoted as
s = lim
n®¥
n

The above definition for arc length along the curve suggests how values of a scalar
field can be summed as one moves through the scalar field along a curve C.

Similarly, define the summation of a vector field as one moves through the field
along a curve C. This produces the following definition of a line integral of a vector
function along a curve C.
Definition (Line integral along a curve C involving a dot product.) Let
F

defined by a position vector r = r(s) = x(s) ˆe1 + y(s) ˆe2 + z(s) ˆe3, is defined as63

In the above definition the dot product F ·

Dsi represents the projection of the
vector F or component of F in the direction of the tangent vector to the curve C. The
line integral of the vector function may be thought of as representing a summation
of the tangential components of the vector F along the curve C between the points
P0 and P1. Line integrals of this type arise in the calculation of the work done in
moving through a force field along a curve. Here the work is given by a summation
of force times distance traveled.
In particular, the above line integral can be expressed in the form

where at each point on the curve C, the dot product F · ˆet is a scalar function of
position and represents the projection of F on the unit tangent vector to the curve.
Summations of cross products along a curve produce another type of line integral.

the ith subinterval of arc length on the curve C.
Integrals of this type arise in the calculation of magnetic dipole moments associated
with current loops.64
Note that each of the line integrals requires knowing the values of x, y and z
along a given curve C and these values must be substituted into the integrand and
after this substitution the summation process reduces to an ordinary integration.
Work Done.
Consider a particle moving from a point PO to a point P1 along a curve C which
lies in a force field F = F (x, y, z). At each point (x, y, z) on the curve there are force
vectors acting on the particle as illustrated in figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19. Moving along a curve C in a force field F .
Examine the particle at a general point (x, y, z) on the given curve C. Construct
the position vector r, the force vector F , and the tangent vector dr acting at this
general point on the curve. The line integral

is a summation of the tangential component of the force times distance traveled
along the curve C. Consequently, the above integral represents the work done in
moving through the force field from point P0 to P1 along the curve C.
Example 6-30. Let a particle with constant mass m move along a curve C
which lies in a vector force field F = F (x, y, z). Also, let r denote the position vector
of the particle in the force field and on the curve C. As the particle moves along the
curve, at each point (x, y, z) of the curve, the particle experiences a force F (x, y, z)65
which is determined by the vector force field. Newton’s second law of motion is
expressed
F = ma = m

The work done in moving along the curve C between two points A and B can then

F · dr is called the work done in moving
the particle from A to B through the force field F . The quantity Ek(v) = m
2 v2 is called
the kinetic energy of the particle. The above equation tells us that the work done in
moving a particle from A to B in a force field F must equal the change in the kinetic
energy of the particle between the points A and B.

Here F · ˆet is the tangential component of the force F along the given
curve C. This form of the line integral is used if F = F (s) and ˆet are
known functions of the arc length s.
3. For a force field given by
F = F (x, y, z) = F1(x, y, z) ˆe1 + F2(x, y, z) ˆe2 + F3(x, y, z) ˆe3
and the position vector of a point (x, y, z) on a curve C given by
r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3 with dr = dx ˆe1 + dy ˆe2 + dz ˆe3,
Here the work done is represented in the form
 B

Line integrals are written in this form when a parametric representation
of the curve is known. In the special case where r = x ˆe1 + 0 ˆe2 + 0 ˆe3, the
above line integral reduces to an ordinary integral.
4. The line integral

F · dr may be broken up into a sum of line integrals

where the direction of integration is either in the counterclockwise sense
or clockwise sense. Whenever the line integral is  represented in the form

 F · dr then it is to be understood that the integration direction is in
the counterclockwise sense which is known as the positive sense. Note
that when the curve is a simple closed curve, there is no need to specify
a beginning and end point for the integration. One need only specify a
direction to the integration. The integration is said to be in the positive
sense if the integration is in a counterclockwise direction or it is said67
to be in the negative sense if the direction of integration is clockwise.
The sense of integration is the same as that for angular measure. The
situation is illustrated in figure 6-20.
Figure 6-20. Direction of integration for line integrals.
The direction of integration around a simple closed curve can be
referenced with respect to the unit outward normal ˆen and to the unit
tangent vector ˆet to the simple close curve as the direction of the unit
tangent produces an oriented simple closed curve.

Chapter 7
Vector Calculus I
One aspect of vector calculus can be described as taking many of the concepts
from scalar calculus, generalizing these concepts and representing them in a vector
format. These alternative vector representations have many applications in representing
two-dimensional and three-dimensional physical problems. Let us begin by
examining the representation of curves using vectors.
Curves
A two-dimensional curve can be defined
(i) Explicitly y = f(x)
(ii) Implicitly F(x, y) = 0
(iii) Parametrically x = x(t), y = y(t)
(iv) As a vector r = r(t) = x(t) ˆe1 + y(t) ˆe2 or r = r(x) = x ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2
A three-dimensional curve can be defined
(i) Parametrically x = x(t), y = y(t), z = z(t)
(ii) As a vector r = r(t) = x(t) ˆe1 + y(t) ˆe2 + z(t) ˆe3
(iii) A curve in space is sometimes defined as the intersection of two surfaces
F(x, y, z) = 0 and G(x, y, z) = 0 and in this special case the curve
is defined by a set of (x, y, z) values which are common to both surfaces.
It is assumed that the functions used to define these curves are continuous singlevalued
functions which are everywhere differentiable. Also note that the parametric
and vector representations of a curve are not unique.
In two-dimensions a parametric curve {x(t), y(t)}, for a £ t £ b has end points
(x(a), y(a)) and (x(b), y(b)). A curve is called a closed curve if its end points coincide
and x(a) = x(b) and y(a) = y(b). If (x0, y0) is a point on the given curve, which is not an
end point, such that there exists more than one value of the parameter t such that
(x(t), y(t)) = (x0, y0), then the point (x0, y0) is called a multiple point or a point where
the curve crosses itself. A curve is called a simple closed curve if it has no multiple
points and the end points coincide. Simple closed curves are defined by one-to-one
mappings. The above definitions of end points, closed curve, simple closed curve and
multiple points apply to parametric curves {x(t), y(t), z(t)} in three-dimensions and to
n-dimensional parametric curves defined by {x1(t), x2(t), . . . , xn(t)} as the parameter t
ranges from a to b.82
A curve is called an oriented curve if
(i) The curve is piecewise smooth.
(ii) The position vector r = r(t), when expressed in terms of a parameter t, determines
the direction of the tangent vector to each point on the curve.
(iii) The direction of the tangent vector is said to determine the orientation of the
curve.
(iv) A plane curve which is a simple closed curve which does not cross itself is said
to have either a clockwise or counterclockwise orientation which depends upon
the directions of the tangent vector at each point on the closed curve.
Tangents to Space Curve
In three-dimensions the derivative vector
dr
dt
= x(t) ˆe1 +y(t) ˆe2+z(t) ˆe3 is tangent
to the point (x(t), y(t), z(t)) on the curve r = r(t) = x(t) ˆe1 +y(t) ˆe2 +z(t) ˆe3 for any fixed
value of the parameter t. The tangent line to the curve r = r(t) at the point where
the parameter has the value t = t* is given by
R
= R(l) = r(t*) + l
dr
dt t=t*
-¥ < l < ¥
where l is a parameter. The tangent line defined by the vector R can also be
expressed in the expanded form
R
= R (l) = (x(t*) + lx(t*)) ˆe1 + (y(t*) + ly(t*)) ˆe2 + (z(t*) + lz(t*)) ˆe3
where t* represents some fixed value of the parameter t. The element of arc length
ds along the curve r = r(t) is obtained from the relation
ds2 = dr · dr = (dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2 =

which shows that the derivative of the position vector with respect to arc length s
produces a unit tangent vector to the curve.82
A curve is called an oriented curve if
(i) The curve is piecewise smooth.
(ii) The position vector r = r(t), when expressed in terms of a parameter t, determines
the direction of the tangent vector to each point on the curve.
(iii) The direction of the tangent vector is said to determine the orientation of the
curve.
(iv) A plane curve which is a simple closed curve which does not cross itself is said
to have either a clockwise or counterclockwise orientation which depends upon
the directions of the tangent vector at each point on the closed curve.
Tangents to Space Curve
In three-dimensions the derivative vector
dr
dt
= x(t) ˆe1 +y(t) ˆe2+z(t) ˆe3 is tangent
to the point (x(t), y(t), z(t)) on the curve r = r(t) = x(t) ˆe1 +y(t) ˆe2 +z(t) ˆe3 for any fixed
value of the parameter t. The tangent line to the curve r = r(t) at the point where
the parameter has the value t = t* is given by
R
= R(l) = r(t*) + l
dr
dt t=t*
-¥ < l < ¥
where l is a parameter. The tangent line defined by the vector R can also be
expressed in the expanded form
R
= R (l) = (x(t*) + lx(t*)) ˆe1 + (y(t*) + ly(t*)) ˆe2 + (z(t*) + lz(t*)) ˆe3
where t* represents some fixed value of the parameter t. The element of arc length

which shows that the derivative of the position vector with respect to arc length s
produces a unit tangent vector to the curve.83
Example 7-1. Reflection property for the parabola.
The parabola y2 = 4px with focus F having coordinates (p, 0) can be represented
parametrically. One parametric representation for the position vector is
r = r(t) =
t2
4p
ˆe1 + t ˆe2, -¥ < t < ¥ (7.3)
and the resulting parabola is illustrated in the figure 7-1. In this figure assume the
surface of the parabola is a mirrored surface.
Figure 7-1. Light ray PB gets reflected to ray through focus.
The derivative vector
dr
dt
= r (t) =

ˆe1 + ˆe2
produces a tangent vector to the curve and the vector

2p
ˆe1 + ˆe2

1 + t2/4p2
=
teˆ1 + 2p ˆe2
4p2 + t2
is a unit tangent vector to the curve.
Consider a general point P on the parabola where a light ray PB parallel to the
x-axis hits the parabola. Construct the normal to the parabola and label the angle
ÐBPC the angle q1 and then label the angle ÐFPC the angle q2. The angle q1 is
called the angle of incidence and the angle q2 is called the angle of reflection. Also84
in figure 7-1 are the complementary angles to q1 and q2. These angles are labeled as
 and .
Construct the vector r1 from point P to the focus F and by
using vector addition show with the aid of equation (7.3) that
r(t) +r1 = p ˆe1 or r1 = (p - t2/4p) ˆe1 - t ˆe2
A unit vector in the direction of r1 is
ˆer1 =
(p - t2  /4p) ˆe1 - t eˆ2
(p - t2/4p)2 + t2
=
(4p2 - t2) ˆe1 - 4pt eˆ2
(4p2 - t2)2 + 16p2t2
Using the definition of the dot product one can show
ˆet · ˆe1 = cos  =
t 
4p2 + t2
(-ˆet) · ˆer1 = cos  =
-t(4p2 - t2) + 8p2t 
4p2 + t2

(4p2 + t2)2 + 16p2t2
=
t(t2 + 4p2) 
4p2 + t2

(4p2 + t2)2 + 16p2t2
If cos = cos  for all values of the parameter t, then one must show that
t 
4p2 + t2
=
t(t2 + 4p2) 
4p2 + t2

(4p2 + t2)2 + 16p2t2
(7.4)
Using algebra one can establish that equation (7.4) is indeed true and so the angles
 and  are equal. Simplify the equation (7.4) to the form

(4p2 + t2)2 + 16p2t2 = t2 + 4p2
and then square both sides to show
16p4 - 8p2t2 + t4 + 16p2t2 = (t2 + 4p2)2
which reduces to the identity (t2 + 4p2)2 = (t2 + 4p2)2. The equality of the angles 
and  implies q1 = q2 or the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
One can also show that the distances AF=FP which shows the triangle PFA is an
isosceles triangle with angle ÐFAP equal to angle ÐAPF implying the complementary
angles q1 and q2 are equal. These results show that all light coming in parallel to
the x-axis will be reflected by the mirrored parabolic surface and pass through the
focus. Conversely, if a light source is placed at the focus, than rays of light from the
focus are reflected parallel to the x-axis.85
Example 7-2. Reflection property of the ellipse.
Consider the ellipse
x2
a2 +
y2
b2 = 1 having eccentricity e < 1 and foci at the points
F1, F2 with coordinates (c, 0) and(-c, 0) respectively. For this ellipse b2 = a2 - c2 and
c = ae. If P represents an arbitrary point (x0, y0) on the ellipse, then one can construct
the vector r1 from P to F1 and also construct the vector r2 from point P to F2. The
magnitude of these vectors when summed gives
|r1| + |r2| = 2a (7.5)
The vectors r1, r2 and the ellipse are illustrated in the figure 7-2. If the ellipse is
mirrored, then a ray of light from the focus F1 will reflect from an arbitrary point P
on the ellipse to the focus at F2.
Figure 7-2. Light ray from one focus passes through other focus.
The position vector of a general point on the ellipse can be represented in the
parametric form
r = r(t) = a cos t ˆe1 + b sin t ˆe2, 0 £ t £ 2 (7.6)
A point P on the ellipse with coordinates (x0, y0) is described by equation (7.6) by
assigning the proper value for the parameter t. The proper value for the parameter
t, call it t0, is determined by solving the equations
x0 = a cos t and y0 = b sin t86
simultaneously, to obtain t0 = tan-1
	
ay0
bx0


. The derivative vector
dr
dt
= -a sin t ˆe1 + b cos t ˆe2
evaluated at the value t0, represents a tangent vector to the ellipse at the point P.
A unit vector in the direction of the tangent line at the point P is then given by
ˆet =
-a sin t eˆ1 + b cos t ˆe2
a2 sin2 t + b2 cos2 t
where everything is understood to be evaluated at t = t0. Using vector addition one
can show the vectors r1 and r2 must satisfy
r(t) +r1 = c ˆe1 and r(t) + r2 + c ˆe1 = 0
These equations allow one to express the vectors r1 and r2 in the form
r1 =(c - a cos t) ˆe1 - b sin t ˆe2
r2 =(-c - a cos t) ˆe2 - b sin t ˆe2
where again, these vectors are to be evaluated at the parameter value t0.
Unit vectors in the directions of r1 and r2 can be expressed
ˆer1 =
(c - a cos t) eˆ1 - b sint eˆ2
(c - a cos t)2 + b2 sin2 t
ˆer2 =
-(c + a cos t) ˆe1 - b sin t ˆe2
(c + a cos t)2 + b2 sin2 t
By employing the definition of the dot product of unit vectors one can verify that
ˆer1 · (-ˆet) = cos  =
a sin t(c - a cos t) + b2 sin t cos t
r1

a2 sin2 t + b2 cos2 t
ˆer2 · ( ˆet) = cos  =
a sin t(c + a cos t) - b2 sin t cos t
(2a - r1)

a2 sin2 t + b2 cos2 t
where r1 = |r1| =

(c - a cos t)2 + b2 sin2 t. If cos  = cos  for all values of the parameter
t, then one must show that
a sin t(c - a cos t) + b2 sin t cos t
r1

a2 sin2 t + b2 cos2 t
=
a sin t(c + a cos t) - b2 sin t cos t
(2a - r1)

a2 sin2 t + b2 cos2 t
(7.7)87
Using algebra one can verify that the equation (7.7) reduces down to an identity so
that the angles  and  are equal. This in turn implies q1 = q2 which states that the
angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
Sound waves also are reflected in the same way. Elliptically shaped rooms or
domes have the property that someone whispering at one focus of the ellipse can
easily be heard at the other focus of the ellipse. This gives rise to the phrase
“whispering galleries”. Constructions which make use of this reflection property
of the ellipse can be found at Statuary Hall in the United States capital, St Paul’s
Cathedral in London, the Grand Central Terminal in New York City and in certain
museums throughout the world.
Example 7-3. Reflection property of the hyperbola.
Figure 7-3.
Light ray directed toward one focus reflects and goes through other focus.
Sketch the hyperbola
x2
a2
-
y2
b2 = 1 with foci F1, F2 having coordinates (-c, 0)
and (c, 0) respectively, where c = ae and e > 1 is the eccentricity of the hyperbola.
Construct an incident ray aimed at the focus F2 which passes through a known point
(x0, y0) on the hyperbola. Label the point where this ray intersects the hyperbola
as point P. Sketch the tangent line and normal line to the hyperbola at the point
P and label the angle of incidence as q1 and the angle of reflection as q2. The88
complementary angles associated with these angles are labeled  and  respectively.
Next construct the vector r1 running from the point P on the hyperbola to the focus
F1 and then construct the vector r2 running from the P to the other focus F2 as
illustrated in the figure 7-3.
The position vector to a general point on the right branch of the hyperbola can
be expressed
r = r(t) = a cosh t ˆe1 + b sinht ˆe2
where t is a parameter. The value of the parameter t, call it t0, corresponding to the
point P having coordinates (x0, y0) is obtained by solving the equations
x0 = a cosh t and y0 = b sinht
simultaneously to obtain t0 = tanh-1

ay0
bx0

. The derivative of the position vector is
dr
dt
= a sinht ˆe1 + b cosh t ˆe2
and this vector, when evaluated using the parameter value t0 is a tangent vector to
the hyperbola at the point P. The vector


dr
dt
=
a sinht ˆe1 + b cosh t ˆe2 Ö
a2 sinh2t + b2 cosh 2t
also evaluated at t0, is a unit tangent vector to the hyperbola at the point P. Using
vector addition one can show that the vectors r1 and r2 are given by
r1 = - (a cosh t + c) ˆe1 - b sinht
r2 = - (a cosh t - c) ˆe1 - b sinht ˆe2
all to be evaluated at the parameter value t0. Unit vectors in the directions of r1
and r2 are
ˆer1 =
-(a cosht + c) ˆe1 - b sinht ˆe2
(a cosh t + c)2 + b2 sinh2t
ˆer2 =
-(a cosht - c) ˆe1 - b sinht ˆe2
(a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t
also to be evaluated at t = t0. The given hyperbola satisfies the properties that
a2 + b2 = c2 and |r1| - |r2| = 2a or

(a cosht + c)2 + b2 sinh2t -

(a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t = 2a89
for all values of the parameter t. The angles a and b constructed at the point P can
be calculated from the dot products
(-ˆet) · ˆer2 = cos a =
a sinht (a cosh t + c) + b2 sinht cosh t
(
Ö
a2 sinh2t + b2 cosh 2t)((a cosh t + c)2 + b2 sinh2t)
=
a sinht (a cosh t + c) + b2 sinht cosh t
(
Ö
a2 sinh2t + b2 cosh 2t)((a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t + 2a)
(7.8)
(-ˆet) · ˆer1 = cos b =
a sinht (a cosh t - c) + b2 sinht cosh t
(
Ö
a2 sinh2t + b2 cosh 2t)((a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t)
(7.9)
If cos a = cos b then one must show that the right-hand sides of equations (7.8)
and (7.9) are equal. Setting the right-hand sides equal to one another and simplifying
produces
a2 sinht cosh t + ac sinht + b2 sinht cosh t
(a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t + 2a
=
a2 sinht cosh t - ac sinht + b2 sinht cosh t
(a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t
(7.10)
To show equation (7.10) reduces to an identity, first show equation (7.10) can be
written
|r2| =
c cosh t - a
c cosh t + a
(a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t + 2a
and then use the fact that c2 = a2 + b2 and |r2| = c cosh t - a to simplify the above
equation to the form
c cosht + a = (a cosh t - c)2 + b2 sinh2t + 2a (7.11)
It is now an easy exercise to show equation (7.11) reduces to an identity.
All this algebra shows that the angles a and b are equal and consequently the
complementary angles q1 and q2 are also equal, showing the hyperbola has the property
that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. The above results
imply that a ray of light aimed at the focus F2 will be reflected and pass through the
other focus. This reflection property of the hyperbola is one of the basic principles
used in the construction of a reflecting telescope.90
Normal and Binormal to Space Curve

The zero dot product in equation (7.13) demonstrates that the vector
d ˆet

is perpendicular
to the unit tangent vector ˆet. Note that this vector can be calculated
using the chain rule for differentiation
d ˆet
ds
ds
dt
=
d ˆet

where
ds
dt
is calculated using
the equation (7.1). Observe that there are an infinite number of vectors which are
perpendicular to the unit tangent vector ˆet. The unit vector with the same direction
as the vector
d ˆet
ds
is called the principal unit normal vector to the curve r(t) for each
value of the parameter t. The principal unit normal vector in the direction of the
derivative vector
d ˆet
ds
is given the label ˆen. The vector
d ˆet
ds
has the same direction
as ˆen and so one can write
d ˆet
ds
= k ˆen (7.14)
where k is a scaling constant called the curvature of the curve r(t). The curvature
k will vary as the parameter t changes. The quantity  = 1
k is called the radius of
curvature at the point associated with the parameter value of t. The unit vector ˆeb
calculated from the cross product of ˆet and ˆen, ˆeb = ˆet× ˆen, is perpendicular to both
the unit tangent ˆet and unit normal ˆen and is called the unit binormal vector to the
curve as the parameter t changes.
The vectors ˆet, ˆen, ˆeb are called a moving
triad along the curve r(t) because the unit vectors
ˆet, ˆen, ˆeb generated a localized right-handed
coordinate system which changes as the parameter
t changes. The plane which contains the unit
tangent ˆet and principal normal ˆen is called the
osculating plane. The plane containing the unit91
binormal ˆeb and unit normal ˆen is called the normal plane. The plane which is perpendicular
to the principal normal ˆen is called the rectifying plane. Let r(t*) denote
the position vector to a fixed point on the given curve and let r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3
denote the position vector to a variable point in one of these planes. One can then
show
The osculating plane can be written (r - r(t*)) · ˆeb = 0
The normal plane can be written (r - r(t*)) · ˆet = 0
The rectifying plane can be written (r -r(t*)) · ˆen = 0
(7.15)
The equations of the straight lines through the fixed point r(t*) and having the
directions of ˆet, ˆen or ˆeb are given by
(r -r(t*)) × ˆet =0 Tangent line
(r -r(t*)) × ˆen =0 Line normal to curve
(r - r(t*)) × ˆeb =0 Line in binormal direction
(7.16)
Let us examine the three unit vectors ˆet, ˆeb and ˆen and their derivatives with
respect to the arc length parameter s. One can calculate the derivatives
d ˆet
ds
,
d ˆeb
ds
and
d ˆen
ds
with the aid of the triple scalar product relations
A
· (B × C ) = B · (C × A) = C · (A× B )
It has been demonstrated that
d ˆet
ds
= k ˆen and ˆeb = ˆet × ˆen, consequently one finds
that
d ˆeb
ds
= ˆet ×
d ˆen

+
d ˆet
ds
× ˆen = ˆet ×
d ˆen
ds
+ k ˆen × ˆen = ˆet ×
d ˆen
ds
(7.17)
Take the dot product of both sides of equation (7.17) with the vector ˆet and use the
above triple scalar product result to show
ˆet ·
d ˆeb
ds
= ˆet · ˆet ×
d ˆen
ds
= 0
This result shows that the vector ˆet is perpendicular to the vector
d ˆeb
ds
. By differentiating
the relation ˆeb · ˆeb = 1 one finds that
ˆeb ·
d ˆeb
ds
+
d ˆeb
ds
· ˆeb = 2 ˆeb ·
d ˆeb
ds
= 092
which implies that the vector
d ˆeb
ds
is also perpendicular to the vector ˆeb. These two
results show that the derivative vector
d ˆeb
ds
must be in the direction of the normal
vector ˆen. Hence, there exists a constant K such that
d ˆeb
ds
= K ˆen (7.18)
where K is a constant. By convention, the constant K is selected as - , where  is
called the torsion and the reciprocal  =
1

is called the radius of torsion. Taking the
dot product of both sides of equation (7.18) with the unit vector ˆen gives
 =  (s) = -ˆen ·
d ˆeb
ds
(7.19)
The torsion is a measure of the twisting of a curve out of a plane and is a measure
of how the osculating plane changes with respect to arc length. The torsion can be
positive or negative and if the torsion is zero, then the curve must be a plane curve.
The three vectors ˆet, ˆeb, ˆen form a right-handed system of unit vectors and so one
can write ˆen = ˆeb × ˆet. Differentiating this relation with respect to arc length gives
d ˆen
ds

ds
+
d ˆeb

Recall that if B is a vector which rotates about a line with angular velocity w,
then
dB
dt
= w × B . One can use this result to give a physical interpretation to the

2 Joseph Alfred Serret (1819-1885) A French mathematician.
3 See chapter 10 for a description of the matrix notation.93
This is interpreted as showing the vector ˆet rotates about a line through ˆeb with
angular velocity w. If the curvature k = 0, then w is also zero and so the tangent
vector ˆet is not rotating and consequently the curve is a straight line. Similarly, one
can write
d ˆeb

ˆet × ˆeb = w × ˆeb where w = 
ds
dt
ˆet
and this result is interpreted as meaning the vector ˆeb is rotating about the ˆet
direction with angular velocity w. If the torsion  = 0, then there is no rotation
of the binormal vector and so the curve remains a plane curve in the plane of the
normal and tangent vectors.
It is left as an exercise to give a physical interpretation to the derivative

Example 7-6. Velocity and Acceleration.
A physical example illustrating the use of the unit tangent and normal vectors
is found in determining the normal and tangential components of the velocity and
acceleration vectors as a particle moves along a curve. If r denotes the position
vector of the particle, v its velocity, and a its acceleration, then
v =
dr
dt
, a =
dv
dt

where s is the arc length along the curve. Using chain rule differentiation gives
v =
dr
dt
=
dr
ds
ds
dt
= ˆetv.95
Analysis of this equation demonstrates that the velocity vector v is directed along
the tangent vector at any time t and has the magnitude given by v = ds
dt which
represents the speed of the particle.
The derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time t is the acceleration
and
a =
dv

= ˆet
dv
dt
+
d ˆet

From the Frenet-Serret formula and using chain rule differentiation, it can be shown
that the time rate of change of the unit tangent vector is
d ˆet

d ˆet

Substituting this result into the acceleration vector gives
a =

ˆen.
The resulting acceleration vector lies in the osculating plane. The tangential component
of the acceleration is given by
dv

, and the normal component of the acceleration
is given by
v2

Surfaces
A surface can be defined
(i) Explicitly z = f(x, y)
(ii) Implicitly F(x, y, z) = 0
(iii) Parametrically x = x(u, v), y = y(u, v), z = z(u, v)
(iv) As a vector r = r(u, v) = x(u, v) ˆe1 + y(u, v) ˆe2 + z(u, v) ˆe3
or r = r(x, y) = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + f(x, y) ˆe3
(v) By rotating a curve about a line.
Here again it should be noted that the parametric representation of a surface is not
unique.
If the functions used to define the above surfaces are continuous and differentiable
functions and are such that the functions defining the surface and their
partial derivatives are all well defined at points on the surface, then the surfaces
are called smooth surfaces. If the surface is defined implicitly by an equation of the
form F(x, y, z) = 0, then those points on the surface where at least one of the partial
derivatives ¶F
¶x , ¶F
¶y , ¶F
¶z is different from zero are called regular points on the surface.
If all of these partial derivatives are zero at a point on the surface, then that point
is called a singular point of the surface.96
To represent a curve on a given surface defined in terms of two parameters u and
v, one can specify how these parameters change. For example, if
r = r(u, v) = x(u, v) ˆe1 + y(u, v) ˆe2 + z(u, v) ˆe3 (7.25)
defines a given surface, then
(i) One can specify that the parameters u and v change as as a function of time
t and write u = u(t) and v = v(t), then the position vector r = r(u, v) becomes a
function of a single variable t
r = r(t) = x(u(t), v(t)) ˆe1 + y(u(t), v(t)) ˆe2 + z(u(t), v(t)) ˆe3, a £ t £ b
which sweeps out a curve lying on the surface.
(ii) If one specifies that v is a function of u, say v = f(u), this reduces the vector
r(u, v) to a function of a single variable which defines the curve on the surface.
This surface curve is given by
r = r(u) = x(u, f(u)) ˆe1 + y(u, f(u)) ˆe2 + z(u, f(u)) ˆe3
(iii) An equation of the form g(u, v) = 0 implicitly defines u as a function of v or v as
a function of u and can be used to define a curve on the surface. The equation
g(u, v) = 0, together with the equation (7.25), is said to define the surface curve
implicitly.
(iv) Consider the special curves
r =r(u, v0) v0 constant
r =r(u0, v) u0 constant
sketched on the surface for the values
u0 Î { ,  + h,  + 2h, + 3h, . . . }
v0 Î { ,  + k,  + 2k,  + 3k, . . . }
where , , h and k have fixed constant values. These special curves are called
coordinate curves on the surface. The partial derivatives
¶r
¶u
and
¶r
¶v
evaluated
at a common point (u0, v0) are tangent vectors to the coordinate curves and the
cross product
¶r
¶u
×
¶r
¶v
produces a normal to the surface.97
Coordinate curves
on sphere.
For example, consider the unit sphere
r(u, v) = cos u sin v ˆe1 + sin u sin v ˆe2 + cos v ˆe3
where 0 £ u £ 2 and 0 £ v £ . The curves r(u0, v) for
equi-spaced constants u0 gives the coordinate curves
called lines of longitude on the sphere. The curves
r(u, v0) for equi-spaced constants v0 give the curves
called lines of latitude on the sphere.
A surface is called an oriented surface if
(i) each nonboundary point on the surface has two unit normals ˆen and -ˆen. By
selecting one of these unit normals one is said to give an orientation to the
surface. Thus, an oriented surface will always have two orientations.
(ii) The unit normal selected defines a surface orientation and this unit normal must
vary continuously over the surface.
(iii) Each nonboundary point on the oriented surface has a tangent plane.
(iv) If the surface is that of a solid, then the unit normal at each point on the surface
which is directed outward from the surface is usually selected as the preferred
orientation for the closed surface.
A surface S is said to be a simple closed surface if the surface divides all of three
dimensional space into three regions defined by
(i) points interior to S, where the distance between any two points inside S is finite.
(ii) points on the surface S.
(iii) points exterior to the surface S.
A smooth surface is one where a normal vector can be constructed at each point
of the surface.
The sphere
The general equation of a sphere is
x2 + y2 + z2 + x + y + 	z + 
 = 0
where , , 	 and 
 are constants. This is a simple closed surface with outward normal
defining its orientation. It is customary to complete the square on the x, y and z
terms and express this equation in the form

After completing the square on the x, y and z terms, the following cases can arise.98

-r2 < 0, then no real sphere exists
In the case the right-hand side of equation (7.26) is negative, then a virtual sphere
is said to exist. A sphere centered at the point (x0, y0, z0) with radius r > 0 has the
form
(x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 + (z - z0)2 = r2 (7.27)
The figure 7-4 illustrates a sphere and projections of the sphere onto the x = 0, y = 0
and z = 0 planes.
A sphere with constant radius r > 0 and centered
at the origin can also be represented in the
parametric form
x = x(, q) = r sin q cos ,
y = y(, q) = r sin q sin,
z = z(, q) = r cos q
(7.28)
where 0 £  £ 2 and 0 £ q £ . These parameters
are illustrated in the accompanying figure. Note
that when q is held constant, one obtains a coordinate curve representing a line of99
latitude on the sphere given by l = p
2
- q and when  is held constant, one obtains
a coordinate curve representing some line of longitude on the sphere.
The representation r = r(, q) = r sin q cos  ˆe1 + r sin q sin ˆe2 + r cos q ˆe3 is a vector
representation for points on the sphere of radius r with r(0, q) a curve of longitude
and r(, q0) a line of latitude and these curves are called coordinate curves on the
surface of the sphere. The vectors
¶r
¶
and
¶r
¶q
are tangent vectors to the coordinate
curves. The cross product
¶r
¶
×
¶r
¶q
produces a normal vector to the surface of the
sphere.

a = b > c it is called an oblate spheroid.
a = b < c it is called a prolate spheroid.
a = b = c it is called a sphere of radius a.

for 0 £ v £ 2 and -h £ u £ h. The elliptic cone centered at the origin is illustrated
in the figure 7-7.101
The position vector r = r(u, v) = au cos v ˆe1 + bu sin v ˆe2 + cu ˆe3 describes a point on
the surface centered at the origin and the curves r(u0, v), r(u, v0) define the coordinate
curves. The partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v are tangent vectors to
the coordinate curves and these vectors can be used to construct a normal vector to
the surface.

where 0 £ u £ 2 and -h < v < h. Here h is usually selected as a small number, say
h = 1 as the selection of h as a large number gives a scaling difference between the
parameters and distorts the final image.

It can also be represented by the parametric equations
x - x0 = a cos v sinhu, y - y0 = b sin v sinhu, z - z0 = c coshu (7.37)
where 0 £ v £ 2 and 0 £ u £ h, with both c > 0 and c < 0 producing a surface with
two parts. Here again the selection of h should be of the same magnitude or less
than v or else the final image gets distorted. The hyperboloid of one sheet and some
hyperboloids of two sheets are illustrated in the figure 7-8. Note in this figure that
the axes x, y and z have undergone various permutations. These permutations show
that the axis of symmetry for the hyperboloid of two sheets is always associated with
the term which has the positive sign. In a similar fashion one can do a permutation
of the symbols x, y and z in the equation describing the hyperboloid of one sheet to
obtain different axes of symmetry.
Figure 7-8. Hyperboloid of one sheet and several hyperboloids of two sheets.
In a similar fashion one can perform a permutation of the symbols x, y and z to
give alternative representations of any of the surfaces previously defined.
One can use the parametric equations to define a position vector r = r(u, v) from
which the coordinate curves r(u0, v) and r(u, v0) can be constructed. The partial
derivatives of r(u, v) with respect to u and v produce tangent vectors to the coordinate
curves and these tangent vectors can be used to construct a normal vector to each
point on the surface.103
The Hyperbolic Paraboloid

the equation

(x - x0)2

(y - y0)2

This surface is saddle shaped and can also be described using the parametric

where -h £ u £ h and -k £ v £ k for selected constants h and k. These parametric
equations can be used to construct the two-parameter surface r(u, v) from which the
coordinate curves and normal vector can be constructed.
It is left as an exercise to show that under a rotation of axes and scaling using
the equations
x - x0
a
= ¯x cos q - ¯y sin q,
y - y0
b
= ¯x sin q + ¯y cos q,
z - z0
c

with q = /4, the hyperbolic paraboloid can be represented ¯z = ¯x¯y.

Surfaces of Revolution
Any surface which can be created by rotating a curve about a fixed line is called
a surface of revolution. The fixed line about which the curve is rotated is called the
axis of revolution. Some examples of surfaces of revolution are the sphere which is
created by rotating the semi-circle x2 + y2 = r2, -r £ x £ r and y ³ 0 about the y = 0104
axis. A paraboloid is obtained by rotating the parabola y = x2, 0 £ x £ x0 about the
x = 0 axis.
The general procedure for determining the equation for representing a surface of
revolution is as follows. First select a general point P on the given curve and then
rotate the point P about the axis of revolution to form a circle. This usually involves
some parameter used to describe the general point. One can then determine the
equation of the surface by eliminating the parameter from the resulting equations.
Example 7-7. A curve y = f(x) for a £ x £ b is rotated about the x-axis.
Find the equation describing the surface of revolution.
Solution A general point P on the given
curve, when rotated about the x-axis produces
the circle y2 + z2 = r2, where r = f(x)
is the radius of the circle. Eliminating the
parameter r gives the equation of the surface
of revolution as y2 + z2 = [f(x)]2
Example 7-8. The curve y = f(z) for a £ z £ b is rotated about the z-axis.
Find the equation describing the surface of revolution.
Solution A general point P on the given
curve is rotated about the z-axis to form
the circle x2 + y2 = r2 where r = f(z) is the
radius of the circle. Eliminating r between
these two equations gives the equation for
the surface of revolution as x2 + y2 = [f(z)]2
Example 7-9. A curve described by the parametric equations x = x(t), y = y(t),
z = z(t) for t0 £ t £ t1, is rotated about the line
x - x0
b1
=
y - y0
b2
=
z - z0
b3
where b = b1 ˆe1 + b2 ˆe2 + b3 ˆe3 is the direction vector of the line. Find the equation of
the surface of revolution.105
Solution In the figure 7-10 the point P represents a general point on the space curve.
Let the coordinates of this point be denoted by (x(t*), y(t*), z(t*)) where t0 £ t* £ t1
and t* is held constant. Construct the vector rP from the origin to the point P and
construct the position vector r0 from the origin to the fixed point (x0, y0, z0) on the
axis of rotation. A unit vector in the direction of the axis or rotation is described
by
ˆeB =
1
|b|
b =
b1 ˆe1 + b2 ˆe2 + b3 eˆ3
b21
+ b22
+ b23
= B1 ˆe1 + B2 ˆe2 + B3 ˆe3 (7.40)
where ˆeB · ˆeB = B2
1 + B2
2 + B2
3 = 1. Also construct the vector rP - r0 from the point
(x0, y0, z0) to the point P as illustrated in the figure 7-10.
Figure 7-10. Space curve revolved about line to form surface of revolution.
Consider a line perpendicular to the axis of rotation and passing through the
point P. Denote by Q the point where this line intersects the axis of rotation. The
distance s from the point (x0, y0, z0) to the point Q is given by the projection of the
vector rP -r0 onto the unit vector ˆeB. This projection gives the distance
s = ˆeB · (rP - r0) (7.41)
The point Q can be described by the position vector
rQ = r0 + s ˆeB (7.42)
The distance from P to Q represents the radius of the circle of revolution when the
point P is revolved about the axis of rotation. This distance, call it R, is given by106
the magnitude of the vector rP - rQ and one can determine this distance from the
dot product relation
R2 = (rP -rQ) · (rP -rQ) (7.43)
Construct the unit vector ˆeA pointing from the point Q to the point P by expanding
the equation
ˆeA =
rP - rQ
|rP - rQ|
=
rP - rQ
R
(7.44)
The unit vector ˆeC which is perpendicular the unit vectors ˆeA and ˆeB can be constructed
using the cross product
ˆeC = ˆeA × ˆeB (7.45)
Note that when the point P is revolved about the axis of rotation, the circle generated
lies in the plane of the vectors ˆeA and ˆeC and a point on this circle can be described
using the equation
r = rQ + Rcos q ˆeA + Rsin q ˆeC, 0 £ q £ 2 (7.46)
Recall that the point P represents a general point on the space curve and so the
vector in equation (7.46) is really a function of the two variables t and q and one
can express the equation (7.46) as the two parameter surface described by
r = r(t, q) = rQ + Rcos q ˆeA + Rsin q ˆeC, 0 £ q £ 2 (7.47)
where the vectors rQ, ˆeA and ˆeC are all calculated in terms of the parameter t and
can be constructed using the equations (7.40), (7.41), (7.42), (7.43), (7.44), (7.45).
That is, to construct the surface of revolution, one can construct a circle for each
value of the space parameter t varying between two fixed values, say t0 £ t £ t1.
An alternative method for constructing the circles of revolution of each point P
on the space curve for t0 £ t £ t1 is as follows. First, assume P is fixed and construct
the sphere centered at the point (x0, y0, z0) which passes through the point P. This
sphere has a radius given by r = |rP -r0| and this radius is a function of the parameter
t* used to describe the point P. The equation of the sphere centered at (x0, y0, z0)
and passing through the point P is given by
(x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 + (z - z0)2 = r2 (7.48)107
Next construct the plane which passes through the point P and is perpendicular to
the axis of rotation. The equation of this plane is given by
(r - rP ) · ˆeB = 0 or (x - x(t*))B1 + (y - y(t*))B2 + (z - z(t*))B3 = 0 (7.49)
This plane is the plane of rotation of the point P and it intersects the sphere in the
circle described by the point P as it moves around the axis of rotation. To obtain the
equation for the surface of revolution one must eliminated the parameter t* from the
equations (7.48) and (7.49). This elimination is not always an easy task to perform.
Ruled Surfaces
A surface r = r(u, v) or z = f(x, y) or F(x, y, z) = 0 is called a ruled surface if it has
the following property. Through each point on the surface it is possible to draw a
straight line which lies entirely on the surface. For example, consider the set of all
straight lines which pass through a fixed point V and which intersect a fixed curve
C, which is not a straight line through V . The surface generated is called a general
cone with the point V called the vertex of the cone, the curve C being called the
directrix of the cone and the lines on the surface of the cone are called the generating
lines. Some example cones are illustrated in the figure 7-11.
Figure 7-11. A cone is an example of a ruled surface.
Another example of a ruled surface are general cylindrical surfaces which can be
described as a collection of straight lines all parallel to a given direction.108
In general, a ruled surface can be thought of as set of points created by moving
a straight line. One way of creating the equation of a ruled surface is to consider
two curves where both curves are defined in terms of a parameter t and represented
by the position vectors r1(t) and r2(t) as illustrated in the figure 7-12.
Figure 7-12. Generating a ruled surface using two curves.
For a fixed value of the parameter t, one can draw a straight line between the two
points r1(t) and r2(t) as illustrated in the figure 7-12. If r is the position vector to a
general point on this line it can be represented by the equations
r = r(t, u) = (1 - u)r1(t) + ur2(t) - u0 £ u £ u0 (7.50)
where u is a parameter and u0 is some specified constant . Note that when u = 0,
then r = r1 and when u = 1, r = r2. As the parameter t changes the line sweeps out
a surface.
Ruled surfaces can be observed on cylinders, cones, hyperboloids of one sheet, as
well as elliptic and hyperbolic paraboloids. Ruled surfaces have been studied since
the time of the early Greeks and many architectural structures can be described as
ruled surfaces.109
Surface Area
The position vector
r = r(u, v) = x(u, v) ˆe1 + y(u, v) ˆe2 + z(u, v) ˆe3  £ u £ , 	 £ v £ 
 (7.51)
defines a surface in terms of two parameters u and v. The family of curves r(u, v0),
with v0 taking on selected constant values, defines a set of coordinate curves on the
surface. Similarly, the family of curves r(u0, v), with u0 taking on selected constant
values, defines another set of coordinate curves. The vector ¶r
¶u is a tangent vector to
the coordinate curve r(u, v0) and the vector ¶r
¶v is a tangent vector to the coordinate
curve r(u0, v). If at every common point of intersection of the coordinate curves
r(u0, v) and r(u, v0) one finds that ¶r
¶v
· ¶r
¶v
(u0,v0)
= 0, then the coordinate curves are
said to form an orthogonal net on the surface.
The vector
dr =
¶r
¶u
du +
¶r
¶v
dv (7.52)
lies in the tangent plane to the point r(u, v) on the surface and one can say that
the vector element dr defines a parallelogram with vector sides ¶r
¶u du and ¶r
¶v dv as
illustrated in the figure 7-13.
Figure 7-13. Defining an element of area on a surface.
Define the element of surface area dS on a given surface as the area of the elemental
parallelogram formed using the vector components of dr. Recall that the magnitude110
of the cross product of the sides of a parallelogram gives the area of the parallelogram
and consequently one can express the element of surface area as

Expanding the equation (7.56) one finds that the element of surface can be represented

The Gradient, Divergence and Curl
The gradient is a field characteristic that describes the spatial rate of change of
a scalar field. Let  = (x, y, z) represent a scalar field, then the gradient of  is a
vector and is written
grad  =
¶
¶x
ˆe1 +
¶
¶y
ˆe2 +
¶
¶z
ˆe3. (7.60)
Here it is assumed that the scalar field  = (x, y, z) possesses first partial derivatives
throughout some region R of space in order that the gradient vector exists. The
operator
 =
¶
¶x
ˆe1 +
¶
¶y
ˆe2 +
¶
¶z
ˆe3 (7.61)
is called the “del ”operator or nabla operator and can be used to express the gradient
in the operator form
grad  =  =

¶
¶x
ˆe1 +
¶
¶y
ˆe2 +
¶
¶z


. (7.62)
Note that the operator is not commutative and  = .
If v = v(x, y, z) = v1(x, y, z) ˆe1 + v2(x, y, z) ˆe2 + v3(x, y, z) ˆe3 denotes a vector field with
components which are well defined, continuous and everywhere differential, then the
divergence of v is defined
divv =
¶v1
¶x
+
¶v2
¶y
+
¶v3
¶z
(7.63)113
Using the del operator  the divergence can be represented
divv =  · v =(
¶
¶x

¶
¶y
ˆe2 +
¶

divv =  · v =
¶v1
¶x

¶v2
¶y

(7.64)
Again make note of the fact that the del operator is not commutative and ·v = v ·.
If the divergence of a vector field is zero,  · v = 0, then the vector field is called
solenoidal.
If v = v(x, y, z) = v1(x, y, z) ˆe1 + v2(x, y, z) ˆe2 + v3(x, y, z) ˆe3 denotes a vector field with

If the curl of a vector field is zero, curl v =  ×v = 0, then the vector field is said to
be irrotational.

Properties of the Gradient, Divergence and Curl
Let u = u(x, y, z) and v = v(x, y, z) denote scalar functions which are continuous
and differentiable everywhere and let A = A(x, y, z) and B= B (x, y, z) denote vector
functions which are continuous and differentiable everywhere. One can then verify
that the del or nabla operator has the following properties.
(i) grad (u + v) = grad u + grad v or (u + v) = u + v
(ii) grad (uv) = u grad v + v grad u or (uv) = uv + vu
(iii) grad f(u) = f(u) gradu or (f(u)) = f(u)u

(v) If a vector field is irrotational curl F = 0, then it is derivable from a scalar
function by taking the gradient, then one can write F = F (x, y, z) = grad u(x, y, z),
or F = u. The vector field F is called a conservative vector field. The function
u from which the vector field is derivable is called the scalar potential.
(vi)  · (A + B ) =  · A + · B or div (A + B ) = div A + div B
(vii)  × (A + B) =  × A +  × B or curl (A + B ) = curl A + curl B
(viii) (uA) = (u) · A + u( · A)
(ix)  × (uA ) = (u) × A + u( × A )
(x)  · (A × B ) = B · ( × A) - A · ( × B )
(xi)  × (A × B ) = (B · )A - B ( · A ) - (A · )B + A( · B )115

(xvi)  · ( × A) = div (curl A) = 0 The divergence of the curl of A is the scalar zero.
(xvii) If a vector field F (x, y, z) is solenoidal, then it is derivable from a vector function
A
= A(x, y, z) by taking the curl. One can then write F = curl A and hence div F = 0.
The vector function A is called the vector potential from which F is derivable.

Directional Derivatives
Let r = r(s) denote an arbitrary space curve which passes through the point
P(x, y, z) of the region R, where the scalar function  = (x, y, z) exists and has all firstorder
partial derivatives which are continuous. Here the space curve is expressed119
in terms of the arc length parameter s, where s is measured from some fixed point
on the curve. In general, the scalar field  = (x, y, z) varies with position and has
different values when evaluated at different points in space. Let us evaluate  at
points along the curve r to determine how  changes with position along the curve.
The rate of change of  with respect to arc length along the curve is given by

=  · ˆet,
where the right-hand side is to be evaluated at a point P on the arbitrary curve r(s)
in R. The right-hand side of this equation is the dot product of the gradient vector
with the unit tangent vector to the curve at the point P and physically represents
the projection of the vector grad  in the direction of this tangent vector. Note that
the curve r(s) represents an arbitrary curve through the point P, and hence, the unit
tangent vector represents an arbitrary direction. Therefore, one may interpret the
derivative df
ds = grad  · e as representing the rate of change of  as one moves in
the direction e. Here the derivative equals the projection of the vector grad  in the
direction e. Such derivatives are called directional derivatives.
(Directional derivative) The component of the gradient f = f(x, y, z) in
the direction of a unit vector ˆe = cos aˆe1 + cos b ˆe2 + cos g ˆe3 is equal to the
projection f · ˆe and is called the directional derivative of f in the direction ˆe.
The directional derivative is written as

where s denotes distance in the direction e. If ˆe= ˆen is a unit normal vector to
a surface, the notation
¶f
¶n
= grad f · ˆen is used to denote a normal derivative
to the surface.
The directional derivative is a measure of how the scalar field  changes as you move
in a certain direction. Since the maximum projection of a vector is the magnitude
of the vector itself, the gradient of  is a vector which points in the direction of120
the greatest rate of change of . The length of the gradient vector is |grad | and
represents the magnitude of this greatest rate of change.
In other words, the gradient of a scalar field is a vector field which represents
the direction and magnitude of the greatest rate of change of the scalar field.
Example 7-19. Show the gradient of f is a normal vector to the surface
f = f(x, y, z) = c = constant.
Solution: Let r(s), where s is arc length, represent any curve lying in the surface
(x, y, z) = c. Along this curve the scalar field has the value  = (x(s), y(s), z(s)) = c
and the rate of change of  along this curve is given by

= grad  ·

= grad  · ˆet = 0.
The resulting equation tells us that the vector grad  is perpendicular to the unit
tangent vector to the curve on the surface. But this unit tangent vector lies in the
tangent plane to the surface at the point of evaluation for the gradient. Thus, grad f
is normal to the surface f(x, y, z) = c. The family of surfaces  = (x, y, z) = c, for
various values of c, are called level surfaces. In two-dimensions, the family of curves
 = (x, y) = c, for various values of c, are called level curves. The gradient of f is a
vector perpendicular to these level surfaces or level curves.
Example 7-20. Find the unit tangent vector at a point on the curve defined
by the intersection of the two surfaces
F(x, y, z) = c1 and G(x, y, z) = c2,
where c1 and c2 are constants.
Solution: If two surfaces F = c1 and G = c2 intersect in a curve, then at a point
(x0, y0, z0) common to both surfaces and on the curve one can calculate the normal
vectors to both surfaces. These normal vectors are
F = grad F and G = grad G
which are evaluated at the point (x0, y0, z0) common to both surfaces and on the
curve of intersection of the surfaces. The cross product
(F) × (G)121
is a vector tangent to the curve of intersection and perpendicular to both of the
normal vectors F and G. A unit tangent vector to the curve of intersection is
constructed having the form form
ˆet =
F × G
|F × G|
.
Example 7-21. In two-dimensions a curve y = f(x) or r = x ˆe1 +f(x) ˆe2 can be
represented in the implicit form  = (x, y) = y - f(x) = 0 so that

given by
ˆen =
-f  (x) ˆe1 + ˆe2
1 + [f(x)]2
The vector T =
dr
dx
= ˆe1 + f(x) ˆe2 and unit vector ˆet =
ˆe1 + f (x) ˆe2
1 + [f(x)]2
are tangent to
the curve and one can verify that ˆen · ˆet = 0 showing these vectors are orthogonal.
Applications for the Gradient
In two-dimensions, let ˆe = cos ˆe1 +sin  ˆe2 denote a unit vector in an arbitrary,
but constant, direction  and let  = (x, y) denote any scalar function of position.
At a point (x0, y0), the directional derivative of  in the direction  becomes
d
ds
= grad  · ˆe =
¶
¶x
cos  +
¶
¶y
sin 
and the magnitude of this directional derivative changes as the angle  changes. As
the angle  varies, the maximum and minimum directional derivatives, at the point
(x0, y0), occur in those directions  which satisfy
d
d

d
ds

= -
¶
¶x
sin  +
¶
¶y
cos  = 0. (7.72)
Note there exists two angles  lying in the region between 0 and 2 radians which
satisfy the above equation. These directions must be tested to see which corresponds
to a maximum and which corresponds to a minimum directional derivative. These
6 Always remember that there are two normals to a curve, namely ˆen and -ˆen,122
angles specify the directions one should travel in order to achieve the maximum (or
minimum) rate of change of the scalar .
A physical example illustrating this idea is heat flow. Heat always flows from
regions of higher temperature to regions of lower temperature. Let T(x, y) denote a
scalar field which represents the temperature T at any point (x, y) in some region R
within a material medium. The level curves T(x, y) = T0 are called isothermal curves
and represent the constant “levels”of temperature. The vector grad T, evaluated
at a point on an isothermal curve, points in the direction of greatest temperature
change. The vector is also normal to the isothermal curve. Fourier’s law of heat
conduction states that the heat flow q [joules/cm2 sec] is in a direction opposite to
this greatest rate of change and
q = -k grad T,
where k [joules/cm-sec-deg C] is the thermal conductivity of the material in which
the heat is flowing.
Example 7-22. In two-dimensions a curve y = f(x) can be represented
in the implicit form  = (x, y) = y - f(x) = 0 so that
grad  =

ˆe2 = -f(x) ˆe1 + ˆe2 = N

curve is given by
ˆen =
-f  (x) ˆe1 + ˆe2
1 + [f(x)]2
Another way to construct this normal vector is as follows. The position vector r
describing the curve y = f(x) is given by r = x ˆe1+f(x) ˆe2 with tangent
dr
dx
= ˆe1+f(x) ˆe2.
The unit tangent vector to the curve is given by ˆet =
ˆe1 + f (x) ˆe2
1 + [f(x)]2
. The vector ˆe3
is perpendicular to the planar surface containing the curve and consequently the
vector ˆe3 × ˆet is normal to the curve. This cross product is given by
ˆe3 × ˆet =
-f (x) ˆe1 + ˆe2

and produces a unit normal vector to the curve. Note that there are always two
normals to every curve or surface. It is important to observe that if N is normal to
a point on the surface, then the vector -N is also a normal to the same point on123
the surface. If the surface is a closed surface, then one normal is called an inward
normal and the other an outward normal.
Maximum and Minimum Values
The directional derivative of a scalar field  in the direction of a unit vector e
has been defined by the projection
d

= grad  · e.
Define a second directional derivative of  in the direction e as the directional derivative

ˆe = cos ˆe1 + sin ˆe2

Directional derivatives can be used to determine the maximum and minimum
values of functions of several variables. Recall from calculus a function of a single
variable y = f(x) has a relative maximum (or relative minimum) at a point x0 if for
any x in a neighborhood of x0 and different from x0, the inequality f(x) < f(x0) (or124
f(x) > f(x0)) holds. The determination of relative maximum and minimum values of
a differential function y = f(x) over an interval (a, b) consists of
1. Determining the critical points where f(x) = 0 and then testing these critical
points.
2. Testing the boundary points x = a and x = b.
The second derivative test for relative maximum and minimum values states
that if x0 is a critical point, then
1. f(x) has the maximum value f(x0) if f(x0) < 0 (i.e., curve is concave downward
if the second derivative is negative).
2. f(x) has a minimum value f(x0) if f(x0) > 0 (i.e., the curve is concave upward if
the second derivative is positive).
The above concepts for the relative maximum and minimum values of a function
of one variable can be extended to higher dimensions when one must deal with
functions of more than one variable. The extension of these concepts can be accomplished
by utilizing the gradient and directional derivatives.
In the following discussion, it is assumed that the given surface is in an explicit
form. If the surface is given in the implicit form F(x, y, z) = 0, then it is assumed that
one can solve for z in terms of x and y to obtain z = z(x, y). By a delta neighborhood
of a point (x0, y0) in two-dimensions is meant the set of all points inside the circular
disk
N0(
) = {x, y | (x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 < 
2 }.
The function z(x, y), which is continuous and whose derivatives exist, has a relative
maximum at a point (x0, y0) if z(x, y) < z(x0, y0) for all x, y in a some 
 neighborhood
of (x0, y0). Similarly, the function z(x, y) has a relative minimum at a point (x0, y0) if
z(x, y) > z(x0, y0) for all x, y in some 
 neighborhood of the point (x0, y0). Points where
the surface z = z(x, y) has a relative maximum or minimum are called critical points
and at these points one must have
¶z
¶x
= 0 and
¶z
¶y
= 0
simultaneously. Critical points are those points where the tangent plane to the
surface z = z(x, y) is parallel to the x, y plane. If the points (x, y) are restricted to a
region R of the plane z = 0, then the boundary points of R must be tested separately
for the determination of any local maximum or minimum values on the surface.124
f(x) > f(x0)) holds. The determination of relative maximum and minimum values of
a differential function y = f(x) over an interval (a, b) consists of
1. Determining the critical points where f(x) = 0 and then testing these critical
points.
2. Testing the boundary points x = a and x = b.
The second derivative test for relative maximum and minimum values states
that if x0 is a critical point, then
1. f(x) has the maximum value f(x0) if f(x0) < 0 (i.e., curve is concave downward
if the second derivative is negative).
2. f(x) has a minimum value f(x0) if f(x0) > 0 (i.e., the curve is concave upward if
the second derivative is positive).
The above concepts for the relative maximum and minimum values of a function
of one variable can be extended to higher dimensions when one must deal with
functions of more than one variable. The extension of these concepts can be accomplished
by utilizing the gradient and directional derivatives.
In the following discussion, it is assumed that the given surface is in an explicit
form. If the surface is given in the implicit form F(x, y, z) = 0, then it is assumed that
one can solve for z in terms of x and y to obtain z = z(x, y). By a delta neighborhood
of a point (x0, y0) in two-dimensions is meant the set of all points inside the circular
disk
N0(
) = {x, y | (x - x0)2 + (y - y0)2 < 
2 }.
The function z(x, y), which is continuous and whose derivatives exist, has a relative
maximum at a point (x0, y0) if z(x, y) < z(x0, y0) for all x, y in a some 
 neighborhood
of (x0, y0). Similarly, the function z(x, y) has a relative minimum at a point (x0, y0) if
z(x, y) > z(x0, y0) for all x, y in some 
 neighborhood of the point (x0, y0). Points where
the surface z = z(x, y) has a relative maximum or minimum are called critical points
and at these points one must have
¶z
¶x
= 0 and
¶z
¶y
= 0
simultaneously. Critical points are those points where the tangent plane to the
surface z = z(x, y) is parallel to the x, y plane. If the points (x, y) are restricted to a
region R of the plane z = 0, then the boundary points of R must be tested separately
for the determination of any local maximum or minimum values on the surface.125
The problem of determining the relative maximum and minimum values of a
function of two variables is now considered. In the discussions that follow, note
that the problem of determining the maximum and minimum for a function of two
variables is reduced to the simpler problem of finding the maximum and minimum
of a function of a single variable.
If (x0, y0) is a critical point associated with the surface z = z(x, y), then one can
slide the free vector given by ˆe = cos  ˆe1+sin ˆe2 to the critical point and construct
a plane normal to the plane z = 0, such that this plane contains the vector ˆe. This
plane intersects the surface in a curve. The situation is depicted graphically in the
figure 7-14
At a critical point where ¶z
¶x = 0 and ¶z
¶y = 0, the directional derivative satisfies
dz

for all directions .
Figure 7-14. Curve of intersection with plane containing ˆe.
Here the directional derivative represents the variation of the surface height z
with respect to a distance s in the ˆe direction. (i.e., measure the rate of change126
of the scalar field z which represents the height of the curve.) To picture what the
above equations are describing, let
x = x0 + s cos  and y = y0 + s sin 
represent the equation of the line of intersection of the plane z = 0 with the plane
normal to z = 0 containing ˆe. The plane containing ˆe and the normal to the plane
z = 0 intersects the surface z(x, y) in a curve given by
z = z(x, y) = z(x0 + s cos , y0 + s sin ) = z(s).
The directional derivative of the scalar field z(x, y) in the direction  is then
dz

Observe that the curve of intersection z = z(s) is a two-dimensional curve, and
the methods of calculus may be applied to determine the relative maximum and
minimum values along this curve. However, one must test this curve of intersection
corresponding to all directions .
One can conclude that at a critical point (x0, y0) one must have dz
ds = 0 for all .
If in addition d2z
ds2 > 0 for all directions , then z0 = z(x0, y0) corresponds to a relative
minimum. If the second derivative d2z
ds2 < 0 for all directions , then z0 = z(x0, y0)
corresponds to a relative maximum.

The sign of the second directional derivative determines whether a maximum or
minimum value for z exists, and hence one must be able to analyze this derivative
for all directions . Let

represent the values of the second partial derivatives evaluated at a critical point

more tractable for analysis. Factor out the leading term and then complete the
square on the first two terms to obtain

Figure 7-15. Saddle point for z(x0, y0)
One can now make the following observations:
1. If AC - B2 = zxxzyy - (zxy)2 = 0, then in those directions  which satisfy cos  +
B
A sin  = 0, the second derivative vanishes. For all other values of , the second
derivative is of constant sign, which is the same sign as A. If the above conditions
are satisfied, then the second derivative test for a maximum or minimum fails.
2. If AC -B2 = zxxzyy -(zxy)2 < 0, then the second derivative is not of constant sign,
but assumes different signs in different directions . In particular, for the special
case  = 0 one finds d2z
ds2 = A and for  satisfying cos  + B
A sin = 0 there results
d2z
ds2 =
A(AC - B2)
A2 sin2 .128
Hence, if A > 0, then A(AC - B2) is negative and alternatively if A < 0, then
A(AC - B2) is positive. In either case, the second derivative has a nonconstant
sign value and in this situation the critical point (x0, y0) is said to correspond to
a saddle point. Such a critical point is illustrated in figure 7-15.
3. If AC -B2 = zxxzyy -(zxy)2 > 0, the second derivative is of constant sign, which is
the sign of A.
(a) If A > 0, d2z
ds2 > 0, the curve z = z(s) is concave upward for all a, and hence
the critical point corresponds to a relative minimum.
(b) If A < 0, d2z
ds2 < 0, the curve z = z(s) is concave downward for all a, and
therefore the critical point corresponds to a relative maximum.
Example 7-24. Find the maximum and minimum values of
z = z(x, y) = x2 + y2 - 2x + 4y
Solution: The first and second partial derivatives of z are
¶z
¶x
= 2x - 2,
¶z
¶y
= 2y + 4, A =
¶2z
¶x2 = 2, C =
¶2z
¶y2 = 2, B =
¶2z
¶x ¶y
= 0
Setting the first partial derivatives equal to zero and solving for x and y gives the
critical points. For this example there is only one critical point which occurs at
(x0, y0) = (1,-2). From the second derivatives of z one finds A = 2, B = 0, C = 2 and
AC - B2 = 4 > 0, and consequently the critical point (1,-2) corresponds to a relative
minimum of the function.
The use of level curves to analyze complicated surfaces is sometimes helpful. For
example, the level curves of the above function can be expressed in the form
z = z(x, y) = (x - 1)2 + (y + 2)2 - 5 = k = constant.
By assigning values to the constant k one can determine the general character of the
surface. It is left as an exercise to show these level curves are circles which are cross
section of the surface known as a paraboloid.
Lagrange Multipliers
Consider the problem of finding stationary values associated with a function
f = f(x, y) subject to a constraint condition that g = g(x, y) = 0. Recall that a necessary129
condition for f = f(x, y) to have an extremum value at a point (a, b) requires that the
differential df = 0 or
df =
¶f
¶x
dx +
¶f
¶y
dy = 0. (7.75)
Whenever the small changes dx and dy are independent, one obtains the necessary
conditions that
¶f
¶x
= 0 and
¶f
¶y
= 0
at a critical point. Whenever a constraint condition is required to be satisfied,
then the small changes dx and dy are no longer independent and one must find the
relationship between the small changes dx and dy as the point (x, y) moves along the
constraint curve. From the differential relation dg = 0 one finds that
dg =
¶g
¶x

must be satisfied. Assume that ¶g

The equations (7.78) can be interpreted that when a member of the family of
curves f(x, y) = c = constant is tangent to the constraint curve g(x, y) = 0, there results

One can give a physical picture of the problem. Think of the constraint condition
given by g = g(x, y) = 0 as defining a curve in the x, y-plane and then consider the
family of level curves f = f(x, y) = c, where c is some constant. A representative
sketch of the curve g(x, y) = 0, together with several level curves from the family,
f = c are illustrated in the figure 7-17. Among all the level curves that intersect the
constraint condition curve g(x, y) = 0 select that curve for which c has the largest or
smallest value. Here it is assumed that the constraint curve g(x, y) = 0 is a smooth
curve without singular points.
If (a, b) denotes a point of tangency between a curve of the family f = c and
the constraint curve g(x, y) = 0, then at this point both curves will have gradient
vectors that are collinear and so one can write f + lg = 0 for some constant l
called a Lagrange multiplier. This relationship together with the constraint equation
produces the three scalar equations

Lagrange viewed the above problem in the following way. Define the function
F(x, y, l) = f(x, y) + lg(x, y) (7.80)
where f(x, y) is called an objective function and represents the function to be maximized
or minimized. The parameter l is called a Lagrange multiplier and the
function g(x, y) is obtained from the constraint condition. Lagrange observed that a
stationary value of the function F, without constraints, is equivalent to the problem131
of stationary values of f with a constraint condition because one would have at a
stationary value of F the conditions

= g(x, y) =0 The constraint condition.
(7.81)
These represent three equations in the three unknowns x, y, l that must be solved.
The equations (7.80) and (7.81) are known as the Lagrange rule for the method of
Lagrange multipliers.
The method of Lagrange multipliers can be
applied in higher dimensions. For example,
consider the problem of finding maximum
and minimum values associated with a function
f = f(x, y, z) subject to the constraint
conditions g(x, y, z) = 0 and h(x, y, z) = 0. Here
the equations g(x, y, z) = 0 and h(x, y, z) = 0
describe two surfaces that may or may not
intersect. Assume the surfaces intersect to
give a space curve.
The problem is to find an extremal value of f = f(x, y, z) as (x, y, z) varies along
the curve of intersection of surfaces g = 0 and h = 0. At a critical point where a
stationary value exists, the directional derivative of f along this curve must be zero.
Here the directional derivative is given by
df
ds
= f · ˆet, where ˆet is a unit tangent
vector to the space curve and f = gradf denotes the gradient of f. Note that if
the directional derivative is zero, then f must lie in a plane normal to the curve of
intersection.
Another way to view the problem, and also suggest that the concepts can be
extended to higher dimensional spaces, is to introduce the notation ¯x = (x1, x2, x3) =
(x, y, z) to denote a vector to a point on the curve of intersection of the two surfaces
g(x1, x2, x3) = 0 and h(x1, x2, x3) = 0. At a stationary value of f one must have
df =
¶f
¶x1
dx1 +
¶f
¶x2
dx2 +
¶f
¶x3
dx3 = gradf · d¯x = 0132
This implies that gradf is normal to the curve of intersection since it is perpendicular
to the tangent vector d¯x to the curve of intersection. At a stationary point, the
normal plane containing the vector gradf also contains the vectors g and h since
dg = gradg · d¯x = 0 and dh = gradh · dx = 0 at the stationary point. Hence, if these
three vectors are noncollinear, then there will exist scalars l1 and l2 such that
f + l1g + l2h = 0 (7.82)
at a stationary point. The equation (7.82) is a vector equation and is equivalent to
the three scalar equations

depending upon the notation you are using. These three equations together with
the constraint equations g = 0 and h = 0 gives us five equations in the five unknowns
x, y, z, l1, l2 that must be satisfied at a stationary point.
By the Lagrangian rule one can form the function
F = F(x, y, z, l1, l2) = f(x, y, z) + l1g(x, y, z)+ l2h(x, y, z)
where f(x, y, z) is the objective function, g(x, y, z) and h(x, y, z) are the constraint
functions and l1, l2 are the Lagrange multipliers. Observe that F has a stationary
value where

These are the same five equations, with unknowns x, y, z, l1, l2, for determining the
stationary points as previously noted.133
Generalization of Lagrange Multipliers
In general, to find an extremal value associated with a n-dimensional function
given by f = f(¯x) = f(x1, x2, . . . , xn) subject to k constraint conditions that can be
written in the form gi(¯x) = gi(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = 0, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, where k is less than
n. It is required that the gradient vectors g1,g2, . . . ,gk be linearly independent
vectors, then one can employ the method of Lagrange multipliers as follows. The
Lagrangian rule requires that the function F = f +
k
i=1
ligi can be written in the
expanded form
(7.84)
which contains the objective function f, summed with each of the constraint functions
gi, multiplied by a Lagrange multiplier li, for the index i having the values
i = 1, . . . , k. Here the function F and consequently the function f has stationary values
at those points where the following equations are satisfied
¶F
¶xi
=0, for i = 1, . . . , n
¶F
¶lj
=0, for j = 1, . . . , k
(7.85)
The equations (7.85) represent a system of (n+k) equations in the (n+k) unknowns
x1, x2, . . . , xn, l1, l2, . . . , lk for determining the stationary points. In general, the stationary
points will be found in terms of the li values. The vector (¯x0,¯l0) where ¯x0 and
¯l
0 are solutions of the system of equations (7.85) can be thought of as critical points
associated with the Lagrangian function F(¯x,¯ l) given by equation (7.84). The resulting
stationary points must then be tested to determine whether they correspond
to a relative maximum value, minimum value or saddle point. One can form the
Hessian7 matrix associated with the function F(¯x;¯ l) and analyze this matrix at the
7 See page 318 for definition of Hessian matrix.134
critical points. Whenever the determinant of the Hessian matrix is zero at a critical
point, then the critical point (¯x0,¯l0) is said to be degenerate and one must seek an
alternative method to test for an extremum.
Vector Field and Field Lines
A vector field is a vector-valued function representing a mapping from Rn to
a vector V . Any vector which varies as a function of position in space is said to
represent a vector field. The vector field V = V (x, y, z) is a one-to-one correspondence
between points in space (x, y, z) and a vector quantity V . This correspondence is
assumed to be continuous and differentiable within some region R. Examples of
vector fields are velocity, electric force, mechanical force, etc. Vector fields can be
represented graphically by plotting vectors at selected points within a region. These
kind of graphical representations are called vector field plots. Alternative to plotting
many vectors at selected points to visualize a vector field, it is sometimes easier to
use the concept of field lines associated with a vector field. A field line is a curve
where at each point (x, y, z) of the curve, the tangent vector to the curve has the
same direction as the vector field at that point. If r = x(t) ˆe1 + y(t) ˆe2 + z(t) ˆe3 is the
position vector describing a field line, then by definition of a field line the tangent
vector dr
dt = dx

dt ˆe2 + dz
dt ˆe3 evaluated at a point t0 must be in the same direction
as the vector V 0 = V (x(t0), y(t0), z(t0). If this relation is true for all values of the
parameter t, then one can state that the vectors dr
dt and V must be colinear at each
point on the curve representing the field line. This requires

which must be solved to obtain the equations of the field lines.
Surface Integrals
In this section various types of surface integrals are introduced. In particular,
surface integrals of the form

are defined and illustrated. Throughout the following discussion all surfaces are
considered to be oriented (two-sided) surfaces.
Consider a surface in space with an element of surface area dS constructed at
some general point on the surface as is illustrated in figure 7-16.
Figure 7-16. Element of surface area.
In the representation of various vector integrals, it is convenient to define vector
elements of surface area dS whose magnitude is dS and whose direction is the same
as the unit outward normal ˆen to the surface. Define this vector element of surface
area as dS = ˆen dS which can be considered as the limit associated with the area

Normal to a Surface
If ˆen is a normal to a smooth surface, then -ˆen is also normal to the surface.
That is, all smooth orientated surfaces possess two normals. If the surface is a
closed surface, there is an inside surface and an outside surface. The outside surface
is called the positive side of the surface. The unit normal to the positive side of a
surface is called the positive normal or outward normal. If the surface is not closed,
then one can arbitrarily select one side of the surface and call it the positive side,
therefore, the normal drawn to this positive side is also called the outward normal.136
If the surface is expressed in an implicit form F(x, y, z) = 0, then a unit normal
to the surface can be obtained from the relation:
ˆen =
grad F
|grad F|
.
If the surface is expressed in the explicit form z = z(x, y), then a unit normal to
the surface can be found from the relation
ˆen =
grad [z(x, y) - z]
| grad [z(x, y) - z]|

(7.86)
Surfaces can also be expressed in the parametric form
x = x(u, v), y = y(u, v), z = z(u, v),
where u and v are parameters. The functions x(u, v), y(u, v), and z(u, v) must be such
that one and only one point (u, v) maps to any given point on the surface. These
functions are also assumed to be continuous and differentiable. In this case, the
position vector to a point on the surface can be represented as
r = r(u, v) = x(u, v) ˆe1 + y(u, v) ˆe2 + z(u, v) ˆe3.
The curves
r(u, v)
v=Constant
and r(u, v)
u=Constant
sweep out coordinate curves on the surface and the vectors
¶r
¶u
,
¶r
¶v
are tangent vectors to these coordinate curves. A unit normal to the surface at a
point P on the surface can then be calculated from the cross product of the tangent
vectors tangent vectors ¶r
¶u and ¶r
¶v evaluated at the point P. One can calculate the
unit normal
ˆen =
¶r
¶v
× ¶r
¶u 
¶r


.
It should be noted that if the cross product
¶r

¶r
¶u
= 0,
the surface is called a smooth surface. If at a point with surface coordinates (u0, v0)
this cross product equals the zero vector, the point on the surface is called a singular
point of the surface.137
Example 7-25. The parametric equations
x = a cos u sin v, y = a sin u sin v, z = a cos v
with 0 £ u £ 2 and 0 £ v £ , represent the surface of a sphere of radius a. These
parametric equations were obtained from the geometry of figure 7-18.
Figure 7-18. Surface of a sphere of radius a.
The position vector of a point on the surface of this sphere can be represented
by the vector
r(u, v) = a cos u sin v ˆe1 + a sin u sin v ˆe2 + a cos v ˆe3.
For u0 and v0 constants, the curves r(u0, v), 0 £ v £ , are meridian lines on the
sphere while the curves r(u, v0), 0 £ u £ 2, are circles of constant latitude. The
tangent vectors to these curves are found by taking the derivatives
¶r
¶u
= -a sin u sin v ˆe1 + a cos u sin v ˆe2
¶r
¶v
= a cos u cos v ˆe1 + a sin u cos v ˆe2 - a sin v ˆe3.
From these tangent vectors, a normal vector to the surface is constructed by taking
a cross product and

It can be verified that a unit normal to this surface is

r.
That is, the unit outer normal to a point P on the surface of the sphere has the
same direction as the position vector r to the point P.
Example 7-26. If the surface is described in the explicit form z = z(x, y) the
position vector to a point on the surface can be represented
r = r(x, y) = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z(x, y) ˆe3
This vector has the partial derivatives

Example 7-27. Consider a surface described by the implicit form F(x, y, z) = 0.

of z with respect to x and y are given by

Tangent Plane to Surface
Consider a smooth surface defined by the equation
r = r(u, v) = x(u, v) ˆe1 + y(u, v) ˆe2 + z(u, v) ˆe3
In order to construct a tangent plane to a regular point r = r(u0, v0) where the surface
coordinates have the values (u0, v0), one must first construct the normal to the surface
at this point. One such normal is
N
=
¶r
¶u
×
¶r
¶v
= N1 ˆe1 + N2 ˆe2 + N3 ˆe3
The point on the surface is
x0 = x(u0, v0), y0 = y(u0, v0), z0 = z(u0, v0)
which can be described by the position vector r0 = r(u0, v0). If r represents the
variable point
r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3
which varies over the plane through the point (x0, y0, z0), then the vector r -r0 must
lie in the tangent plane and consequently is perpendicular to the normal vector N .
One can then write
(r -r0) · N = 0 (7.87)
as the equation of the plane through the point (x0, y0, z0) which is perpendicular to
N
and consequently tangent to the surface. In equation (7.87) one can substitute
any of the normal vectors calculated in the previous examples.140
The equation of the line through the point (x0, y0, z0) which is perpendicular to
the tangent plane is given by
r = r0 + lN (7.88)
where l is a scalar. The equation of the line can also be expressed by the parametric
equations
x = x0 + lN1, y = y0 + lN2, z = z0 + lN3 (7.89)
where again, the normal vector N can be replaced by any of the normals previously
calculated.
Element of Surface Area
Consider the case where the surface is given in the explicit form z = z(x, y). In
this case, the position vector of a point on the surface is given by
r = r(x, y) = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z(x, y) ˆe3. (7.90)
The curves
r(x, y)
y= Constant
and r(x, y)
x=Constant
are coordinate curves lying in the surface which intersect at a common point (x, y, z).
The vectors
¶r
¶x
= ˆe1 +
¶z
¶x
ˆe3 and
¶r
¶y
= ˆe2 +
¶z
¶y
ˆe3
are tangent to these coordinate curves, and consequently the differential of the position
vector
dr =
¶r
¶x
dx +
¶r
¶y
dy
lies in the tangent plane to the surface at the common point of intersection of the
coordinate curves. This differential is illustrated in figure 7-19.
Consider an element of area DA = DxDy in the xy plane of figure 7-19. When this
element of area is projected onto the surface z = z(x, y), it intersects the surface in an
element of surface area DS. When projected onto the tangent plane to the surface
it intersects the tangent plane in an element of surface area DR. These projections
are illustrated in figure 7-19(c).141
Figure 7-19. Element of surface area and element parallelogram.
In the limit as Dx and Dy tend toward zero, DR approaches DS and one can define
dR = dS , where the element of area dR lies in the tangent plane to the surface at the
point (x, y, z). In the limit as Dx and Dy approach zero, the element of area is defined
as the area of the elemental parallelogram defined by the vector dr and illustrated in
figure 7-19(b). The area of this elemental parallelogram can be calculated from the
cross product relation

Given a surface in the explicit form z = z(x, y), define the outward normal to the

Taking the dot product of both sides of the above equation with the unit vector ˆe3
gives
| ˆe3 · ˆen| dS = dx dy or dS =
dx dy
| ˆe3 · ˆen|
=
dx dy
cos 	
(7.94)
with an absolute value placed upon the dot product to ensure that the surface area
is positive (i.e., recall that there are two normals to the surface which differ in sign).
In equation (7.94), the element of surface area has been expressed in terms of its
projection onto the xy plane. The angle 	 = 	(x, y) is the angle between the outward
normal to the surface and the unit vector ˆe3. This representation of the element of
surface area is valid provided that cos 	 = 0; That is, it is assumed that the surface
is such that the normal to the surface is nowhere parallel to the xy plane.
We have previously shown that for surfaces which have a normal parallel to the
xy plane, the element of surface area can be projected onto either of the planes x = 0
or y = 0. If the surface element is projected onto the plane x = 0, then the element
of surface area takes the form
dS =
dy dz
| ˆe1 · ˆen|
(7.95)
and if projected onto the plane y = 0 it has the form
dS =
dx dz
| ˆe2 · ˆen|
. (7.96)
If the element of surface area dS is projected onto the z = 0 plane, the total
surface area is then
S =

R
dS =

R
dx dy
| ˆe3 · ˆen|
,
where the integration extends over the region R, where the surface is projected onto
the z = 0 plane. Similar integrals result for the other representations of surface area.143
Example 7-28. Find the surface area of that part of the plane
(x, y, z) = 2x + 2y + z - 12 = 0
which lies in the first octant.
Figure 7-20. Surface area of plane in first octant.

The projection of the surface element dS onto the z = 0 plane produces
dS =
dx dy
| ˆe3 · ˆen|
= 3dx dy
By summing dx dy over the region where x > 0, y > 0, and x + y £ 6, one obtains the
limits of integration for the surface area. The surface area is determined from the
integral
S =
 x=6

If the element of surface area is projected onto the plane y = 0, there results
dS =

| ˆe2 · ˆen|
=

2
dx dz144
and the limits of summation are determined as dx and dz range over the region
x > 0, z > 0, and 2x + z £ 12. This produces the surface integral

Element of Volume
In a general (u, v, w) curvilinear coordinate system the (x, y, z) rectangular coordinates
of a point are given as functions of (u, v, w) and written
x = x(u, v, w), y = y(u, v, w), z = z(u, v, w)
so that the position vector to a point P can be written
r = r(u, v, w) = x(u, v, w) ˆe1 + y(u, v, w) ˆe2 + z(u, v, w) ˆe3
The vector ¶r
¶u is tangent to the coordinate curve r = r(u, v0, w0), the vector ¶r
¶v is
tangent to the coordinate curve r = r(u0, v, w0) and the vector ¶r
¶w is tangent to the
coordinate curve r = r(u0, v0, w). Unit vectors to the coordinates curves are

¶r

dw = hu du ˆe1 + hv dv ˆe2 + hw dw ˆe3145
can be thought of as defining an element of volume dV in the shape of a parallelepiped
with vector sides A = hu du ˆe1, B = hv dv ˆe2 and C = hw dw ˆe3. The volume of this
parallelepiped is given by
dV = |A · (B × C )| = |(hu du ˆe1) · ((hv dv ˆe2) × (hw dw ˆe3)| = huhvhw dudv dw
In rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) one finds hx = 1, hy = 1, and hz = 1 and the element
of volume is dV = dxdydz.
In cylindrical coordinates (r, q, z) where x = r cos q, y = r sin q, z = z one finds
hr = 1, hq = r and hz = 1 and the element of volume is dV = r dr dq dz
In spherical coordinates (, q, f) where x =  sinq cos f, y =  sin q sin f, z =  cos q, one
finds h = 1, hq = , hf =  sin q and the element of volume is dV = 2 sin q ddq df
These elements of volume must be summed over appropriate regions of space in
order to calculate volume integrals of the form

Surface Placed in a Scalar Field
If a surface is placed in a region of a scalar field f(x, y, z), one can divide the
surface into n small areas
DS1, DS2, . . . ,DSn.
For n large, define fi = fi(xi, yi, zi) as the value of the scalar field over the surface
element  DSi as i ranges from 1 to n. The summation of the elements fiDSi over all i
as n increases without bound defines the surface integral

where the integration is determined by the way one represents the element of surface

given surface is specified.
Surface Placed in a Vector Field
For a surface S in a region of a vector field F = F (x, y, z) the integral

R
F · dS = 
R
F · ˆendS (7.98)146
represents a scalar which is the sum of the projections of F onto the normals to the
surface elements. If the surface is divided into n small surface elements DSi, where
i = 1, . . . , n. Let F i = F (xi, yi, zi) represent the value of the vector field over the ith
surface element. The summation of the elements
F i ·DS i = F i · ˆeniDSi
over all surface elements represents the sum of the normal components of F i multiplied
by DSi as i varies from 1 to n. A summation gives the surface integral

Again, the form of this integral depends upon how the given surface is represented.
Integrals of this type arise when calculating the volume rate of change associated
with velocity fields. It is called a flux integral and represents the amount of a
substance moving across an imaginary surface placed within the vector field.
The vector integral 
R
F

represents a vector which is obtained by summing the vector elements F i ×DSi over
the given surface. The fundamental theorem of integral calculus enables such sums
to be expressed as integrals and one can write

F × dS . (7.100)
Integrals of this type arise as special cases of some integral theorems that are developed
in the next chapter.
Each of the above surface integrals can be represented in different forms depending
upon how the element of surface area is represented. The form in which
the given surface is represented usually dictates the method used to calculate the
surface area element. Sometimes the representation of a surface in a different form
is helpful in determining the limits of integration to certain surface integrals.147

and F is the vector field F = (x2 + z) ˆe1 + (xy - z) ˆe2 + (x + y) ˆe3
Solution The given surface is illustrated in figure 7-21.
Figure 7-21. Surface of a cube.
The given surface is piecewise continuous and thus the surface integral can be
broken up and written as the sum of the surface integrals over each face of the cube.
The following calculations illustrates the mechanics involved in evaluating this type
of surface integral.

Summary
When a surface is represented in parametric form, the position vector of a point
on the surface can be represented as
r = r(u, v) = x(u, v) ˆe1 + y(u, v) ˆe2 + z(u, v) ˆe3
where
x = x(u, v), y = y(u, v), z = z(u, v)
is the parametric representation of the surface. The differential of the position vector
r = r(u, v) is
dr =
¶r
¶u
du +
¶r
¶v
dv = S 1 + S 2 (7.101)
and this differential can be thought of as a vector addition of the component vectors
S
1 = ¶r
¶u du and S 2 = ¶r
¶v dv which make up the sides on an elemental parallelogram
having area dS lying on the surface. The vectors S 1 and S 2 are tangent vectors to the
coordinate curves r(u, v2) and r(u1, v) where u1 and v2 are constants. A representation
of coordinate curves on a surface and an element of surface area are illustrated in
the figure 7-23.
The unit normal to the surface at a point having the surface coordinates (u, v),
can be found from either of the cross product relations
ˆen = ±
¶r

The above results differing in sign. That is, ˆen and -ˆen are both normals to the
surface and selecting one of these vectors gives an orientation to the surface.
Example 7-32. Find the unit normal to the sphere defined by
x = r cos  sin q, y = r sin sin q, z = r cos q
Solution Here
¶r
¶q
=r cos  cos q ˆe1 + r sin cos q ˆe2 - r sin q ˆe3
¶r
¶
= - r sin  sin q ˆe1 + r cos  sin q ˆe2
and the cross product is


= ˆe1(r2 sin2 q cos f) + ˆe2(r2 sin2 q sin f) + ˆe3(r2 sin q cos q)152
One finds

¶r
¶q
× ¶r
¶f

= r2 sin q so that a unit vector to the surface of the sphere is
ˆen = sin q cos  ˆe1 + sin q sin  ˆe2 + cos q ˆe3
For r a position vector to a point on the surface, the element dr lies in the
tangent plane to the surface at the point determined by the parameters u and v. The
element of surface area dS is also determined from the differential element dr and is
given by the magnitude of the cross products of the vectors S 1 and S 2 representing
the sides of the elemental parallelogram which defines the element of surface area.
This element of surface area is calculated from the cross product

Example 7-33. A cylinder of radius a and height h has the parametric
representation x = x(q, z) = a cos q, y = y(q, z) = a sin q, z = z(q, z) = z, where the
parameters q and z, are illustrated in figure 7-24, and satisfy 0 £ q £ 2 and 0 £ z £ h.
Figure 7-24.
Surface area in cylindrical coordinates.
A point on the surface of the cylinder can be represented by the position vector
r = r(q, z) = a cos q ˆe1 + a sin q ˆe2 + z ˆe3.154
The coordinate curves are
The straight-lines, r(q0, z), 0 £ z £ h
and the circles, r(q, z0), 0 £ q £ 2,
where q0 and z0 are constants. The tangent vectors to the coordinate curves are
given by
¶r
¶q
= -a sin q ˆe1 + a cos q ˆe2 and
¶r
¶z

Consequently, we have E = a2, F = 0, and G = 1. The element of surface area is then
dS =

EG - F2dq dz = a dq dz. The surface area of the cylinder of height h is therefore

Volume Integrals
The summation of scalar and vector fields over a region of space can be expressed
by volume integrals having the form

V
f(x, y, z) dV and

V
F
(x, y, z) dV,
where dV = dx dy dz is an element of volume and V is the region over which the
integrations are to extend.
The integral of the scalar field is an ordinary triple integral. The triple integral
of the vector function F = F(x, y, z) can be expressed as

V
F dV = ˆe1

V
F1(x, y, z) dV + ˆe2

F2(x, y, z) dV + ˆe3

V
F3(x, y, z) dV, (7.106)
where each component is a scalar triple integral.
Whenever appropriate, the above integrals are sometimes expressed
(i) in cylindrical coordinates (r, q, z), where x = r cos q, y = r sin q, z = z and the element
of volume is represented dV = r dr dq dz
(ii) in spherical coordinates (, q, ) where x =  sin q cos , y =  sin q sin , z =  cos q and
the element of volume is dV = 2 sin q dddq.

Example 7-34. Evaluate the integral

V
f(x, y, z) dV, where f(x, y, z) = 6(x+y),
dV = dxdydz is an element of volume and V represents the volume enclosed by the
planes 2x + 2y + z = 12, x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0. The integration is to be performed
over this volume.
Solution
The figure on the left is a copy of the
figure 7-20 with summations of the element
dV illustrated. From this figure the limits of
integration can be determined. The volume
element is dV = dxdydz is placed at the general
point (x, y, z) within the volume. This
volume element can be visualized as a cube
inside the volume. Summation of these cubic
elements aids in determining the limits of integration for the integral to be
calculated. If this cube is summed in the z-direction, a parallelepiped is produced.
This parallelepiped has lower limit z = 0 and upper limit z = 12 - 2x - 2y. If the
parallelepiped is summed in the y-direction, then a triangular slab is formed with
lower limit y = 0 and upper limit y = 6 - x. Summing the triangular slabs in the
x-direction from x = 0 to x = 6 gives the limits of integration in the x-direction. At
each stage of the summation process, the volume element is weighted by the scalar
function f(x, y, z) giving the integral

V
f(x, y, z) dV. From all this summation one
can verify the above integral can be expressed.


This integral is calculated by first integrating in the z-direction holding the other
variables constant. This is followed by an integration in the y-direction holding x
constant. The last integration is then in the x-direction.156
Example 7-35. Evaluate the integral

V
F (x, y, z) dV, where
F = x ˆe1 + xy ˆe2 + ˆe3
and dV = dxdydz is a volume element. The limits of integration are determined from
the volume bounded by the surfaces y = x2, y = 4, z = 0, and z = 4.
Solution From figure 7-25 the limits of integration can be determined by sketching an
element of volume dV = dx dy, dz and then summing these elements in the x-direction
from x = 0 to x =
Ö
y to form a parallelepiped. Next sum the parallelepiped in the
z-direction from z = 0 to z = 4 to form a slab. Finally, the slab can be summed in
y-direction from y = 0 to y = 4 to fill up the volume.

Volume Elements Revisited
Consider the volume element dV = dxdydz from cartesian coordinates and introduce
a change of variables
x = x(u, v, w), y = y(u, v, w), z = z(u, v, w)
from an x, y, z rectangular coordinate system to a u, v, w curvilinear coordinate system.
One finds the vector
r = r(u, v, w) = x(u, v, w) ˆe1 + y(u, v, w) ˆe2 + z(u, v, w) ˆe3
is the position vector of a general point within a region determined by the restrictions
placed upon the u, v, w variables. The surfaces
r(u, v, w0), r(u, v0, w), r(u0, v, w)
are called coordinates surfaces and the curves
r(u0, v0, w), r(u0, v, w0), r(u, v0, w0)
are called coordinate curves. The coordinate curves represent intersections of the
coordinate surfaces. The partial derivatives
¶r

represent tangent vectors to the coordinate curves and the quantities

the coordinate system is called an orthogonal coordinate system. The differential
dr =

of a parallelepiped having the vector sides

As an example, the volume element dV = dx dy dz under the change of variable
to cylindrical coordinates (r, q, z), with coordinate transformation
x = x(r, q, z) = r cos q, y = y(r, q, z) = r sin q, z = z(r, q, z) = z

Cylindrical Coordinates (r, q, z)
The transformation from rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) to cylindrical coordinates
(r, q, z) is given by
x = x(r, q, z) = r cos q, y = y(r, q, z) = r sin q, z = z(r, q, z) = z
so that a general position vector is given by r = r(r, q, z) = r cos q ˆe1 + r sin q ˆe2 + z ˆe3 In
cylindrical coordinates the coordinate surfaces are
r(r0, q, z) =r0 cos q ˆe1 + r0 sin q ˆe2 + z ˆe3 a cylinder
r(r, q0, z) =r cos q0 ˆe1 + r sin q0 ˆe2 + z ˆe3 a plane perpendicular to z-axis
r(r, q, z0) =r cos q ˆe1 + r sin q ˆe2 + z0 ˆe3 a plane through the z-axis
These surfaces are illustrated in the figure 7-26.
Figure 7-26.
Coordinate surfaces and coordinate curves for cylindrical coordinates (r, q, z).
The coordinate curves are
r(r0, q0, z), lines perpendicular to plane z = 0
r(q0, z0), lines emanating from the origin
r(r0, q, z0), circles of radius r0 in the plane z = z0

are unit vectors tangent to the coordinate curves, where ˆer · ˆeq = 0, ˆer · ˆez = 0 and
ˆeq · ˆez = 0. The unit vector ˆez = ˆer × ˆeq produces the triad system { ˆer, ˆeq, ˆez} so that
the cylindrical coordinate system is a right-handed orthogonal coordinate system.

In the cylindrical coordinate system the element of volume is given by dV = r dr dq dz
and the element of surface area is dS = r dq dz. The direction ˆer is called the radial
direction, the direction ˆeq is called the azimuthal direction and the direction ˆez is
called the vertical direction.
Spherical Coordinates (, q, f)
The transformation from rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) to spherical coordinates
(, q, ) is given by the equations
x = x(, q, ) =  sinq cos , y = y(, q, ) =  sin q sin , z = z(, q, ) =  cos q
and the general position vector is given by
r = r(, q, ) =  sin q cos  ˆe1 +  sin q sin  ˆe2 +  cos q ˆe3
In this coordinate system the coordinate surfaces are
r(0, q, ), a sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 20
r(, q0, ), a cone x2 + y2 = tan2 qz2
r(, q, 0), a plane through the z-axis y = x tan
The coordinate curves in spherical coordinates are obtained from the intersection of
the coordinate surfaces and can be represented by
r(0, q0, ), circles of latitude
r(0, q, 0), meridian curve
r(, q0, 0), lines through the origin
These coordinate surfaces and coordinate lines are illustrated in the figure 7-27.

ˆe · ˆeq = 0, ˆe · ˆef = 0, ˆeq · ˆef = 0, ˆe × ˆeq = ˆef

The element of volume in spherical coordinates is given by dV = r2 sin q dq dfdr
and the element of surface area is dS = r2 sin q dq df, with r constant. The direction
ˆer is called the radial direction, the vector ˆeq is called the polar direction11 and the
direction ˆef is called the azimuthal direction.
Example 7-36. For F = (x - z) ˆe1 + (y - x) ˆe2 + (z + x + y) ˆe3, let S denote the
surface enclosing the volume V bounded by the hemisphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1, z ³ 0,
and the plane z = 0. Calculate (i) I1 = 

and show
I1 =  p/2
q=0
 2p
f=0
 1
r=0
3r2 sin q drdfdq = 2p
Break the surface integral I2 into an integration Iupper over the hemisphere and
an integral Ilower surface integral over the plane z = 0. On Iupper use dS = sin q dq df
and ˆen = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3 with F · ˆen = x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. One finds
Iupper =  2p
f=0
 p/2

sin q dq df = 2p
On the plane z = 0, use dS = dxdy and ˆen = -ˆe3 with F · ˆen = -(z+x+y)
z=0

Example 7-37. Let S denote the surface of the hemisphere x2+y2+z2 = 1, z ³ 0
and let C denote the curve x2 +y2 = 1 lying on the surface S. Calculate the integrals

Solution One finds curl F = ˆe3 and on the hemisphere ˆen = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3, so that
curl F · ˆen = z. Let dS =

The angle q is called the polar angle or zenith angle and the angle f is called the azimuthal angle.163

is given by F = F (x, y, z) = z ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + x ˆe3 and S is the surface of the unit sphere
x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.
Solution Transform to spherical coordinates where the position vector to a point of
the unit sphere is
r = x ˆe1 + y ˆe2 + z ˆe3 = sin q cos  ˆe1 + sin q sin ˆe2 + cos q ˆe3
for 0 £  £ 2 and 0 £ q £ . An element of surface area in spherical coordinates is
dS = sin q dqd and a unit normal ˆen to the surface of the unit sphere is in the same
direction as the vector r above so that one can write
ˆen = sin q cos  ˆe1 + sin q sin  ˆe2 + cos q ˆe3
