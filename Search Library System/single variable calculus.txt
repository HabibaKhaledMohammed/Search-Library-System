1. Review
Success in calculus depends on your background in algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry
and functions. In this chapter, we review many of the concepts you will need to know to
succeed in this course.
1.1 Algebra
1.1.1. Sets and Number Systems
A set can be thought of as any collection of distinct objects considered as a whole. Typically,
sets are represented using set-builder notation and are surrounded by braces. Recall that
(, ) are called parentheses or round brackets; [, ] are called square brackets; and {, } are called braces or curly brackets.
Example 1.1: Sets
The collection {a, b, 1, 2} is a set. It consists of the collection of four distinct objects,
namely, a, b, 1 and 2.
Let S be any set. We use the notation x ? S to mean that x is an element inside of the
set S, and the notation x 6? S to mean that x is not an element of the set S.
Example 1.2: Set Membership
If S = {a, b, c}, then a ? S but d 6? S.
The intersection between two sets S and T is denoted by S n T and is the collection
of all elements that belong to both S and T. The union between two sets S and T
is denoted by S?T and is the collection of all elements that belong to either S or T (or both).
Example 1.3: Union and Intersection
Let S = {a, b, c} and T = {b, d}. Then S n T = {b} and S ? T = {a, b, c, d}. Note
that we do not write the element b twice in S ? T even though b is in both S and T.
Numbers can be classified into sets called number systems.
N the natural numbers {1, 2, 3, . . .}
Z the integers {. . . ,-3,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . }
Q the rational numbers Ratios of integers:
n
p
q : p, q ? Z, q 6= 0
o
R the real numbers Can be written using a finite or infinite decimal expansion
C the complex numbers These allow us to solve equations such as x2 + 1 = 0
3CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
In the table, the set of rational numbers is written using set-builder notation. The colon,
:, used in this manner means such that. Often times, a vertical bar | may also be used to
mean such that. The expression
n
p
q : p, q ? Z, q 6= 0
o
can be read out loud as the set of all
fractions p over q such that p and q are both integers and q is not equal to zero.
Example 1.4: Rational Numbers
The numbers -3
4 , 2.647, 17, 0.¯7 are all rational numbers. You can think of rational
numbers as fractions of one integer over another. Note that 2.647 can be written as a
fraction:
2.647 = 2.647 ×
1000
1000
=
2647
1000
.
Also note that in the expression 0.¯7, the bar over the 7 indicates that the 7 is repeated
forever:
0.77777777 . . . =
7
9
.
All rational numbers are real numbers with the property that their decimal expansion
either terminates after a finite number of digits or begins to repeat the same finite sequence
of digits over and over. Real numbers that are not rational are called irrational.
Example 1.5: Irrational Numbers
Some of the most common irrational numbers include:
? v2. Can you prove this is irrational? (The proof uses a technique called con-
tradiction.)
? p. Recall that p (pi) is defined as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to
its diameter and can be approximated by 3.14159265.
? e. Sometimes called Euler’s number, e can be approximated by 2.718281828459.
We will review the definition of e in a later chapter.
Let S and T be two sets. If every element of S is also an element of T, then we say S is
a subset of T and write S ? T. Furthermore, if S is a subset of T but not equal to T, we
often write S ? T. The five sets of numbers in the table give an increasing sequence of sets:
N ? Z ? Q ? R ? C.
That is, all natural numbers are also integers, all integers are also rational numbers, all
rational numbers are also real numbers, and all real numbers are also complex numbers.
1.1.2. Law of Exponents
The Law of Exponents is a set of rules for simplifying expressions that governs the combination
of exponents (powers). Recall that nv denotes the nth root. For example v3 8 = 2
41.1. ALGEBRA
represents that the cube root of 8 is equal to 2.
Definition 1.6: Law of Exponents
Definitions
If m, n are positive integers, then:
1. xn = x · x · . . . · x (n times).
2. x0 = 1, for x 6= 0.
3. x-n =
1
xn , for x 6= 0.
4. xm/n = nvxm or ( nvx)m, for x = 0.
Combining
1. xaxb = xa+b. 2.
xa
xb = xa-b, for x 6= 0. 3. (xa)b ?? = xab = xba =
xb

1. (xy)a = xaya, for x = 0, y = 0. 2.

ya , for x = 0, y > 0.
In the next example, the word simplify means to make simpler or to write the expression
more compactly.
Example 1.7: Laws of Exponents
Simplify the following expression as much as possible assuming x, y > 0:
3x-2y3x
y2vx
.
Solution. Using the Law of Exponents, we have:
3x-2y3x
y2vx

An answer of 3yx-3/2 is equally acceptable, and such an expression may prove to be computationally
simpler, although a positive exponent may be preferred. ?

1.1.3. The Quadratic Formula and Completing the Square
The technique of completing the square allows us to solve quadratic equations and also
to determine the center of a circle/ellipse or the vertex of a parabola.
The main idea behind completing the square is to turn:
ax2 + bx + c
into
a(x - h)2 + k.
One way to complete the square is to use the following formula:
ax2 + bx + c = a

x +
b
2a
2
-
b2
4a2 + c.
But this formula is a bit complicated, so some students prefer following the steps outlined
in the next example.
Example 1.8: Completing the Square
Solve 2x2 + 12x - 32 = 0 by completing the square.
Solution. In this instance, we will not divide by 2 first (usually you would) in order to
demonstrate what you should do when the ‘a’ value is not 1.
2x2 + 12x - 32 = 0 Start with original equation.
2x2 + 12x = 32 Move the number over to the other side.
2(x2 + 6x) = 32 Factor out the a from the ax2 + bx expression.
6 ? 6
2 = 3 ? 32 = 9 Take the number in front of x,
divide by 2,
then square it.
2 (x2 + 6x + 9) = 32 + 2 · 9 Add the result to both sides,
taking a = 2 into account.
2(x + 3)2 = 50 Factor the resulting perfect square trinomial.
You have now completed the square!
(x + 3)2 = 25 ? x = 2 or x = -8 To solve for x, simply divide by a = 2
and take square roots.
?
Suppose we want to solve for x in the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a 6= 0.
The solution(s) to this equation are given by the quadratic formula.
61.1. ALGEBRA
The Quadratic Formula
The solutions to ax2 + bx + c = 0 (with a 6= 0) are x = -b ± vb2 - 4ac
2a
.
Proof. To prove the quadratic formula we use the technique of completing the square. The
general technique involves taking an expression of the form x2 + rx and trying to find a
number we can add so that we end up with a perfect square (that is, (x+n)2). It turns out
if you add (r/2)2 then you can factor it as a perfect square.
For example, suppose we want to solve for x in the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a 6= 0. Then we can move c to the other side and divide by a (remember, a 6= 0 so we can
divide by it) to get
x2 +
b
a
x = -
c
a
.
To write the left side as a perfect square we use what was mentioned previously. We have
r = (b/a) in this case, so we must add (r/2)2 = (b/2a)2 to both sides
x2 +
b

We know that the left side can be factored as a perfect square

x +

2



2
.
The right side simplifies by using the exponent rules and finding a common denominator

x +
b
2a
2
= -4ac + b2
4a2 .
Taking the square root we get
x +
b
2a
= ±
r
-4ac + b2
4a2 ,
which can be rearranged as
x = -b ± vb2 - 4ac
2a
.
In essence, the quadratic formula is just completing the square. ?
1.1.4. Inequalities, Intervals and Solving Basic Inequalities
Inequality Notation
Recall that we use the symbols <,>,=,= when writing an inequality. In particular,
? a < b means a is to the left of b (that is, a is strictly less than b),
7CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
? a = b means a is to the left of or the same as b (that is, a is less than or equal to b),
? a > b means a is to the right of b (that is, a is strictly greater than b),
? a = b means a is to the right of or the same as b (that is, a is greater than or equal to
b).
To keep track of the difference between the symbols, some students use the following mnemonic.
Mnemonic
The < symbol looks like a slanted L which stands for “Less than”.
Example 1.9: Inequalities
The following expressions are true:
1 < 2, -5 < -2, 1 = 2, 1 = 1, 4 = p > 3, 7.23 = -7.23.
The real numbers are ordered and are often illustrated using the real number line:
-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4
-2.5
Intervals
Assume a, b are real numbers with a < b (i.e., a is strictly less than b). An interval is a
set of every real number between two indicated numbers and may or may not contain the
two numbers themselves. When describing intervals we use both round brackets and square
brackets.
(1) Use of round brackets in intervals: ( , ). The notation (a,b) is what we call the open
interval from a to b and consists of all the numbers between a and b, but does not include
a or b. Using set-builder notation we write this as:
(a, b) = {x ? R : a < x < b}.
We read {x ? R : a < x < b} as “the set of real numbers x such that x is greater than a
and less than b” On the real number line we represent this with the following diagram:
a b
Note that the circles on a and b are not shaded in, we call these open circles and use them
to denote that a,b are omitted from the set.
(2) Use of square brackets in intervals: [ , ]. The notation [a,b] is what we call the
closed interval from a to b and consists of all the numbers between a and b and including
a and b. Using set-builder notation we write this as
[a, b] = {x ? R| a = x = b}.
81.1. ALGEBRA
On the real number line we represent this with the following diagram:
a b
Note that the circles on a and b are shaded in, we call these closed circles and use them
to denote that a and b are included in the set.
To keep track of when to shade a circle in, you may find the following mnemonic useful:
Mnemonic
The round brackets (, ) and non-shaded circle both form an “O” shape which stands
for “Open and Omit”.
Taking combinations of round and square brackets, we can write different possible types
of intervals (we assume a < b):
(a, b) = {x ? R : a < x < b} [a, b] = {x ? R : a = x = b} [a, b) = {x ? R : a = x < b}
a b a b a b
(a, b] = {x ? R : a < x = b} (a,8) = {x ? R : x > a} [a,8) = {x ? R : x = a}
a b a a
(-8, b) = {x ? R : x < b} (-8, b] = {x ? R : x = b} (-8,8) = R = all real numbers
b b
Note: Any set which is bound at positive and/or negative infinity is an open interval.
Inequality Rules
Before solving inequalities, we start with the properties and rules of inequalities.
9CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Inequality Rules
Add/subtract a number to both sides:
? If a < b, then a + c < b + c and a - c < b - c.
Adding two inequalities of the same type:
? If a < b and c < d, then a + c < b + d.
Add the left sides together, add the right sides together.
Multiplying by a positive number:
? Let c > 0. If a < b, then c · a < c · b.
Multiplying by a negative number:
? Let c < 0. If a < b, then c · a > c · b.
Note that we reversed the inequality symbol!
Similar rules hold for each of =, > and =.
Solving Basic Inequalities
We can use the inequality rules to solve some simple inequalities.
Example 1.10: Basic Inequality
Find all values of x satisfying
3x + 1 > 2x - 3.
Write your answer in both interval and set-builder notation. Finally, draw a number
line indicating your solution set.
Solution. Subtracting 2x from both sides gives x + 1 > -3. Subtracting 1 from both sides
gives x > -4. Therefore, the solution is the interval (-4,8). In set-builder notation the
solution may be written as {x ? R : x > -4}. We illustrate the solution on the number
line as follows:
-4
?
Sometimes we need to split our inequality into two cases as the next example demonstrates.
Example 1.11: Double Inequalities
Solve the inequality
4 > 3x - 2 = 2x - 1.
101.1. ALGEBRA
Solution. We need both 4 > 3x - 2 and 3x - 2 = 2x - 1 to be true:
4 > 3x - 2 and 3x - 2 = 2x - 1,
6 > 3x and x - 2 = -1,
2 > x and x = 1,
x < 2 and x = 1.
Thus, we require x = 1 but also x < 2 to be true. This gives all the numbers between 1 and
2, including 1 but not including 2. That is, the solution to the inequality 4 > 3x-2 = 2x-1
is the interval [1, 2). In set-builder notation this is the set {x ? R : 1 = x < 2}. ?
Example 1.12: Positive Inequality
Solve 4x - x2 > 0.
Solution. We provide two methods to solve this inequality.
First method. Factor 4x - x2 as x(4 - x). The product of two numbers is positive when
either both are positive or both are negative, i.e., if either x > 0 and 4-x > 0, or else x < 0
and 4-x < 0. The latter alternative is impossible, since if x is negative, then 4-x is greater
than 4, and so cannot be negative. As for the first alternative, the condition 4-x > 0 can be
rewritten (adding x to both sides) as 4 > x, so we need: x > 0 and 4 > x (this is sometimes
combined in the form 4 > x > 0, or, equivalently, 0 < x < 4). In interval notation, this says
that the solution is the interval (0, 4).
Second method. Write 4x - x2 as -(x2 - 4x), and then complete the square, obtaining
-

(x - 2)2 - 4

= 4 - (x - 2)2.
For this to be positive we need (x - 2)2 < 4, which means that x - 2 must be less than 2
and greater than -2: -2 < x - 2 < 2. Adding 2 to everything gives 0 < x < 4.
Both of these methods are equally correct; you may use either in a problem of this type.
?
We next present another method to solve more complicated looking inequalities. In the
next example we will solve a rational inequality by using a number line and test points. We
follow the guidelines below.
11CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Guidelines for Solving Rational Inequalities
1. Move everything to one side to get a 0 on the other side.
2. If needed, combine terms using a common denominator.
3. Factor the numerator and denominator.
4. Identify points where either the numerator or denominator is 0. Such points are
called split points.
5. Draw a number line and indicate your split points on the number line. Draw
closed/open circles for each split point depending on if that split point satisfies
the inequality (division by zero is not allowed).
6. The split points will split the number line into subintervals. For each subinterval
pick a test point and see if the expression in Step 3 is positive or negative. Indicate
this with a + or - symbol on the number line for that subinterval.
7. Now write your answer in set-builder notation. Use the union symbol ? if you
have multiple intervals in your solution.
Example 1.13: Rational Inequality
Write the solution to the following inequality using interval notation:
2 - x
2 + x = 1.
Solution. One method to solve this inequality is to multiply both sides by 2+x, but because
we do not know if 2+x is positive or negative we must split it into two cases (Case 1: 2+x > 0
and Case 2: 2 + x < 0).
Instead we follow the guidelines for solving rational inequalities:
Start with original problem:
2 - x
2 + x = 1
Move everything to one side:
2 - x
2 + x - 1 = 0
Find a common denominator:
2 - x
2 + x -
2 + x
2 + x = 0
Combine fractions:
(2 - x) - (2 + x)
2 + x = 0
Expand numerator:
2 - x - 2 - x
2 + x = 0
Simplify numerator: -2x
2 + x = 0 (*)
Now we have the numerator and denominator in fully factored form. The split points are
121.1. ALGEBRA
x = 0 (makes the numerator 0) and x = -2 (makes the denominator 0). Let us draw a
number line with the split points indicated on it:
-2 0
The point x = 0 is included since if we sub x = 0 into (*) we get 0 = 0 which is true.
The point x = -2 is not included since we cannot divide by zero. We indicate this with
open/closed circles on the number line (remember that open means omit):
-2 0
Now choosing a test point from each of the three subintervals we can determine if the
expression -2x
2+x is positive or negative. When x = -3, it is negative. When x = -1, it is
positive. When x = 1, it is negative. Indicating this on the number line gives:
-2 0
- + -
Since we wish to solve -2x
2+x = 0, we look at where the + signs are and shade that area on the
number line:
-2 0
- + -
Since there is a closed circle at 0, we include it. Therefore, the solution is (-2, 0]. ?
Example 1.14: Rational Inequality
Write the solution to the following inequality using interval notation:
2
x + 2
> 3x + 3.
Solution. We provide a brief outline of the solution. By subtracting (3x + 3) from both
sides and using a common denominator of x + 2, we can collect like terms and simplify to
get:
-(3x2 + 9x + 4)
x + 2
> 0.
The denominator is zero when x = -2. Using the quadratic formula, the numerator is
zero when x = -9±
v33
6 (these two numbers are approximately -2.46 and -0.54). Since the
inequality uses “>” and 0 > 0 is false, we do not include any of the split points in our
solution. After choosing suitable test points and determining the sign of -(3x2+9x+4)
x+2 we have
-2.46 -2
- + -
-0.54
+
Looking where the + symbols are located gives the solution:
 
-8, -9 - v33
6
!
[
 
-2, -9 + v33

.
When writing the final answer we use exact expressions for numbers in mathematics, not
approximations (unless stated otherwise). ?
13CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
1.1.5. The Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number x is written as |x| and represents the distance x is from
zero. Mathematically, we define it as follows:
|x| =

x, if x = 0,
-x, if x < 0.
Thus, if x is a negative real number, then -x is a positive real number. The absolute
value does not just turn minuses into pluses. That is, |2x - 1| 6= 2x + 1. You should be
familiar with the following properties.
Absolute Value Properties
1. |x| = 0.
2. |xy| = |x||y|.
3. |1/x| = 1/|x| when x 6= 0.
4. | - x| = |x|.
5. |x + y| = |x| + |y|. This is called the triangle inequality.
6. vx2 = |x|.
Example 1.15: vx2 = |x|
Observe that
p
(-3)2 gives an answer of 3, not -3.
When solving inequalities with absolute values, the following are helpful.
Case 1: a > 0.
? |x| = a has solutions x = ±a.
? |x| = a means x = -a and x = a (that is, -a = x = a).
? |x| < a means x < -a and x < a (that is, -a < x < a).
? |x| = a means x = -a or x = a.
? |x| > a means x < -a or x > a.
Case 2: a < 0.
? |x| = a has no solutions.
? Both |x| = a and |x| < a have no solutions.
? Both |x| = a and |x| > a have solution set {x|x ? R}.
Case 3: a = 0.
? |x| = 0 has solution x = 0.
141.1. ALGEBRA
? |x| < 0 has no solutions.
? |x| = 0 has solution x = 0.
? |x| > 0 has solution set {x ? R|x 6= 0}.
? |x| = 0 has solution set {x|x ? R}.
1.1.6. Solving Inequalities that Contain Absolute Values
We start by solving an equality that contains an absolute value. To do so, we recall that if
a = 0 then the solution to |x| = a is x = ±a. In cases where we are not sure if the right side
is positive or negative, we must perform a check at the end.
Example 1.16: Absolute Value Equality
Solve for x in |2x + 3| = 2 - x.
Solution. This means that either:
2x + 3 = +(2 - x) or 2x + 3 = -(2 - x)
2x + 3 = 2 - x or 2x + 3 = -2 + x
3x = -1 or x = -5
x = -1/3 or x = -5
Since we do not know if the right side “a = 2 - x” is positive or negative, we must perform
a check of our answers omit any that are incorrect.
If x = -1/3, then we have LS = |2(-1/3) + 3| = | - 2/3 + 3| = |7/3| = 7/3 and
RS = 2 - (-1/3) = 7/3. In this case LS = RS, so x = -1/3 is a solution.
If x = -5, then we have LS = |2(-5)+3| = |-10+3| = |-7| = 7 and RS = 2-(-5) =
2 + 5 = 7. In this case LS = RS, so x = -5 is a solution. ?
We next look at absolute values and inequalities.
Example 1.17: Absolute Value Inequality
Solve |x - 5| < 7.
Solution. This simply means -7 < x - 5 < 7. Adding 5 to each gives -2 < x < 12.
Therefore the solution is the interval (-2, 12). ?
In some questions you must be careful when multiplying by a negative number as in the
next problem.
15CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Example 1.18: Absolute Value Inequality
Solve |2 - z| < 7.
Solution. This simply means -7 < 2 - z < 7. Subtracting 2 gives: -9 < -z < 5. Now
multiplying by -1 gives: 9 > z > -5. Remember to reverse the inequality signs! We can
rearrange this as -5 < z < 9. Therefore the solution is the interval (-5, 9). ?
Example 1.19: Absolute Value Inequality
Solve |2 - z| = 7.
Solution. Recall that for a > 0, |x| = a means x = -a or x = a. Thus, either 2 - z = -7
or 2-z = 7. Either 9 = z or -5 = z. Either z = 9 or z = -5. In interval notation, either z
is in [9,8) or z is in (-8,-5]. All together, we get our solution to be: (-8,-5] ? [9,8).
?
In the previous two examples the only difference is that one had < in the question and
the other had =. Combining the two solutions gives the entire real number line!
Example 1.20: Absolute Value Inequality
Solve 0 < |x - 5| = 7.
Solution. We split this into two cases.
(1) For 0 < |x - 5| note that we always have that an absolute value is positive or zero
(i.e., 0 = |x-5| is always true). So, for this part, we need to avoid 0 = |x-5| from occurring.
Thus, x cannot be 5, that is, x 6= 5.
(2) For |x - 5| = 7, we have -7 = x - 5 = 7. Adding 5 to each gives -2 = x = 12.
Therefore the solution to |x - 5| = 7 is the interval [-2, 12].
To combine (1) and (2) we need combine x 6= 5 with x ? [-2, 12]. Omitting 5 from the
interval [-2, 12] gives our solution to be: [-2, 5) ? (5, 12]. ?

system, also called the (x, y)-plane. Previously, we used (a, b) to represent an open interval.
Notation often gets reused and abused in mathematics, but thankfully, it is usually clear
from the context what we mean.
In the (x, y) coordinate system we normally write the x-axis horizontally, with positive
numbers to the right of the origin, and the y-axis vertically, with positive numbers above the
origin. That is, unless stated otherwise, we take “rightward” to be the positive x-direction
and “upward” to be the positive y-direction. In a purely mathematical situation, we normally
choose the same scale for the x- and y-axes. For example, the line joining the origin to the
point (a, a) makes an angle of 45? with the x-axis (and also with the y-axis).
In applications, often letters other than x and y are used, and often different scales are
chosen in the horizontal and vertical directions.
Example 1.21: Data Plot
Suppose you drop a coin from a window, and you want to study how its height above
the ground changes from second to second. It is natural to let the letter t denote
the time (the number of seconds since the object was released) and to let the letter h
denote the height. For each t (say, at one-second intervals) you have a corresponding
height h. This information can be tabulated, and then plotted on the (t, h) coordinate
plane, as shown in figure 1.1.
We use the word “quadrant” for each of the four regions into which the plane is divided
by the axes: the first quadrant is where points have both coordinates positive, or the
“northeast” portion of the plot, and the second, third, and fourth quadrants are counted off
counterclockwise, so the second quadrant is the northwest, the third is the southwest, and
the fourth is the southeast.
Suppose we have two points A and B in the (x, y)-plane. We often want to know the
change in x-coordinate (also called the “horizontal distance”) in going from A to B. This is

often written x, where the meaning of  (a capital delta in the Greek alphabet) is “change
in”. Thus, x can be read as “change in x” although it usually is read as “delta x”. The
point is that x denotes a single number, and should not be interpreted as “delta times
x”. Similarly, the “change in y” is written y and represents the difference between the
y-coordinates of the two points. It is the vertical distance you have to move in going from
A to B.
Example 1.22: Change in x and y
If A = (2, 1) and B = (3, 3) the change in x is
x = 3 - 2 = 1
while the change in y is
y = 3 - 1 = 2.
The general formulas for the change in x and the change in y between a point (x1, y1)
and a point (x2, y2) are:
x = x2 - x1, y = y2 - y1.
Note that either or both of these might be negative.
1.2.1. Lines
If we have two distinct points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2), then we can draw one and only one
straight line through both points. By the slope of this line we mean the ratio of y to x.
The slope is often denoted by the letter m.
181.2. ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
Slope Formula
The slope of the line joining the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:
m =
y
x
=
(y2 - y1)
(x2 - x1)
=

run
.
Example 1.23: Slope of a Line Joining Two Points
The line joining the two points (1,-2) and (3, 5) has slope m =
5 - (-2)
3 - 1
=
7
2
.
The most familiar form of the equation of a straight line is:
y = mx + b.
Here m is the slope of the line: if you increase x by 1, the equation tells you that you have
to increase y by m; and if you increase x by x, then y increases by y = mx. The
number b is called the y-intercept, because it is where the line crosses the y-axis (when
x = 0). If you know two points on a line, the formula m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) gives you
the slope. Once you know a point and the slope, then the y-intercept can be found by
substituting the coordinates of either point in the equation: y1 = mx1+b, i.e., b = y1-mx1.
Alternatively, one can use the “point-slope” form of the equation of a straight line: start
with (y - y1)/(x - x1) = m and then multiply to get
(y - y1) = m(x - x1),
the point-slope form. Of course, this may be further manipulated to get y = mx-mx1 +y1,
which is essentially the “y = mx + b” form.
It is possible to find the equation of a line between two points directly from the relation
m = (y - y1)/(x - x1) = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1), which says “the slope measured between the
point (x1, y1) and the point (x2, y2) is the same as the slope measured between the point
(x1, y1) and any other point (x, y) on the line.” For example, if we want to find the equation
of the line joining our earlier points A(2, 1) and B(3, 3), we can use this formula:
m =
y - 1
x - 2
=
3 - 1
3 - 2
= 2, so that y - 1 = 2(x - 2), i.e., y = 2x - 3.
Of course, this is really just the point-slope formula, except that we are not computing m in
a separate step. We summarize the three common forms of writing a straight line below:
Slope-Intercept Form of a Straight Line
An equation of a line with slope m and y-intercept b is:
y = mx + b.
19CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Point-Slope Form of a Straight Line
An equation of a line passing through (x1, y1) and having slope m is:
y - y1 = m(x - x1).
General Form of a Straight Line
Any line can be written in the form
Ax + By + C = 0,
where A,B,C are constants and A,B are not both 0.
The slope m of a line in the form y = mx + b tells us the direction in which the line is
pointing. If m is positive, the line goes into the 1st quadrant as you go from left to right. If
m is large and positive, it has a steep incline, while if m is small and positive, then the line
has a small angle of inclination. If m is negative, the line goes into the 4th quadrant as you
go from left to right. If m is a large negative number (large in absolute value), then the line
points steeply downward. If m is negative but small in absolute value, then it points only a
little downward.
If m = 0, then the line is horizontal and its equation is simply y = b.
All of these possibilities are illustrated below.
There is one type of line that cannot be written in the form y = mx+b, namely, vertical
lines. A vertical line has an equation of the form x = a. Sometimes one says that a vertical
line has an “infinite” slope.
It is often useful to find the x-intercept of a line y = mx + b. This is the x-value when
y = 0. Setting mx + b equal to 0 and solving for x gives: x = -b/m.
Example 1.24: Finding x-intercepts
To find x-intercept(s) of the line y = 2x - 3 we set y = 0 and solve for x:
0 = 2x - 3 ? x =
3

.
Thus, the line has an x-intercept of 3/2.
It is often necessary to know if two lines are parallel or perpendicular. Let m1 and m2
be the slopes of the nonvertical lines L1 and L2. Then:
201.2. ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
? L1 and L2 are parallel if and only if m1 = m2.
? L1 and L2 are perpendicular if and only if m2 = -1

(c) Using the slope-intercept formula with m = 2 and b = 4 we get y = 2x + 4.

It has slope m2 = 3/2. Since m1 ·m2 6= -1 (they are not negative reciprocals), the lines are
not perpendicular. Since m1 6= m2 the lines are not parallel.
We find points of intersection by setting y-values to be the same and solving. In particular,

1.2.2. Distance between Two Points and Midpoints
Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), recall that their horizontal distance from one another
is x = x2 - x1 and their vertical distance from one another is y = y2 - y1. Actually, the
word “distance” normally denotes “positive distance”. x and y are signed distances, but
this is clear from context. The (positive) distance from one point to the other is the length
of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs |x| and |y|, as shown in figure 1.2. The
Pythagorean Theorem states that the distance between the two points is the square root of
the sum of the squares of the horizontal and vertical sides:
...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
(x1, y1)
(x2, y2)
x
y
Figure 1.2: Distance between two points (here, x and y are positive).
Distance Formula
The distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is
distance =
p
(x)2 + (y)2 =
p
(x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2.
Example 1.27: Distance Between Two Points
The distance, d, between points A(2, 1) and B(3, 3) is
d =
p
(3 - 2)2 + (3 - 1)2 = v5.
As a special case of the distance formula, suppose we want to know the distance of a
point (x, y) to the origin. According to the distance formula, this is
p
(x - 0)2 + (y - 0)2 =
p
x2 + y2.
A point (x, y) is at a distance r from the origin if and only if
p
x2 + y2 = r, or, if we square
both sides: x2 + y2 = r2. As illustrated in the next section, this is the equation of the circle
of radius, r, centered at the origin.
Furthermore, given two points we can determine the midpoint of the line segment joining
the two points.
Midpoint Formula
The midpoint of the line segment joining two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is the point
with coordinates:
midpoint =

x1 + x2
2
,
y1 + y2
2

.
23CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Example 1.28: Midpoint of a Line Segment
Find the midpoint of the line segment joining the given points: (1, 0) and (5,-2).
Solution. Using the midpoint formula on (x1, y1) = (1, 0) and (x2, y2) = (5,-2) we get:

(1) + (5)
2
,
(0) + (-2)

= (3,-1).
Thus, the midpoint of the line segment occurs at (3,-1). ?

box has a centre of (h, k).
? a is the horizontal distance from the
centre to the edge of the box.
? b is the vertical distance from the centre
to the edge of the box.
25CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Given the equation of a horizontal hyperbola, one may sketch it by first placing a dot
at the point (h, k). Then draw a box around (h, k) with horizontal distance a and vertical
distance b to the edge of the box. Then draw dotted lines (called the asymptotes of the
hyperbola) through the corners of the box. Finally, sketch the hyperbola in a horizontal
direction as illustrated below.

Determining the Type of Conic
An equation of the form
Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0
gives rise to a graph that can be generated by performing a conic section (parabolas,
circles, ellipses, hyperbolas). Note that the Bxy term involves conic rotation. The
Dx, Ex, and F terms affect the vertex and centre. For simplicity, we will omit the
Bxy term. To determine the type of graph we focus our analysis on the values of A
and C.
? If A = C, the graph is a circle.
? If AC > 0 (and A 6= C), the graph is an ellipse.
? If AC = 0, the graph is a parabola.
? If AC < 0, the graph is a hyperbola.
Example 1.29: Center and Radius of a Circle
Find the centre and radius of the circle y2 + x2 - 12x + 8y + 43 = 0.
Solution. We need to complete the square twice, once for the x terms and once for the y
terms. We’ll do both at the same time. First let’s collect the terms with x together, the
terms with y together, and move the number to the other side.
(x2 - 12x) + (y2 + 8y) = -43
We add 36 to both sides for the x term (-12 ? -12
2 = -6 ? (-6)2 = 36), and 16 to both
sides for the y term (8 ? 8
2 = 4 ? (4)2 = 16):
(x2 - 12x + 36) + (y2 + 8y + 16) = -43 + 36 + 16
Factoring gives:
(x - 6)2 + (y + 4)2 = 32.
Therefore, the centre of the circle is (6,-4) and the radius is 3. ?
Example 1.30: Type of Conic
What type of conic is 4x2 - y2 - 8x + 8 = 0? Put it in standard form.
Solution. Here we have A = 4 and C = -1. Since AC < 0, the conic is a hyperbola. Let
us complete the square for the x and y terms. First let’s collect the terms with x together,
the terms with y together, and move the number to the other side.
(4x2 - 8x) - y2 = -8
Now we factor out 4 from the x terms.
4(x2 - 2x) - y2 = -8
27CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Notice that we don’t need to complete the square for the y terms (it is already completed!).
To complete the square for the x terms we add 1 (-2 ? -2
2 = -1 ? (-1)2 = 1), taking
into consideration that the a value is 4:
4 (x2 - 2x + 1) - y2 = -8 + 4 · 1
Factoring gives:
4(x - 1)2 - y2 = -4
A hyperbola in standard form has ±1 on the right side and a positive x2 on the left side,
thus, we must divide by 4:
(x - 1)2 -
y2
4
= -1
Now we can see that the equation represents a vertical hyperbola with centre (1, 0) (and
with a value v1 = 1, and b value v4 = 2). ?
Example 1.31: Equation of Parabola
Find an equation of the parabola with vertex (1,-1) that passes through the points
(-4, 24) and (7, 35).
Solution. We first need to determine if it is a vertical parabola or horizontal parabola.
See figure 1.3 for a sketch of the three points (1,-1), (-4, 24) and (7, 35) in the xy-plane.
Note that the vertex is (1,-1). Given the location of the vertex, the parabola cannot open
x
y
Figure 1.3: Figure for Example 1.31
downwards. It also cannot open left or right (because the vertex is between the other two
points - if it were to open to the right, every other point would need to be to the right of the
vertex; if it were to open to the left, every other point would need to be to the left of the
vertex). Therefore, the parabola must open upwards and it is a vertical parabola. It has an
equation of
y - k = a(x - h)2.
As the vertex is (h, k) = (1,-1) we have:
y - (-1) = a(x - 1)2
281.2. ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
To determine a, we substitute one of the points into the equation and solve. Let us substitute
the point (x, y) = (-4, 24) into the equation:
24 - (-1) = a(-4 - 1)2 ? 25 = 25a ? a = 1.
Therefore, the equation of the parabola is:
y + 1 = (x - 1)2.
Note that if we substituted (7, 35) into the equation instead, we would also get a = 1. ?

1.3 Trigonometry
In this section we review the definitions of trigonometric functions.
1.3.1. Angles and Sectors of Circles
Mathematicians tend to deal mostly with radians and we will see later that some formulas
are more elegant when using radians (rather than degrees). The relationship between degrees
and radians is:
p rad = 180?.
301.3. TRIGONOMETRY
Using this formula, some common angles can be derived:
Degrees 0? 30? 45? 60? 90? 120? 135? 150? 180? 270? 360?

From now on, unless otherwise indicated, we will always use radian measure.

an arc with length s.
When ? is measure in radians, we have the following formula relating ?, s and r:
? =
s

If a circle has radius 3 cm, then an angle of 2 rad is subtended by an arc of 6 cm
(s = r? = 3 · 2 = 6).

1.3.2. Trigonometric Functions
There are six basic trigonometric functions:
? Sine (abbreviated by sin)
? Cosine (abbreviated by cos)
? Tangent (abbreviated by tan)
? Cosecant (abbreviated by csc)
? Secant (abbreviated by sec)
? Cotangent (abbreviated by cot)
We first describe trigonometric functions in terms of ratios of two sides of a right angle
triangle containing the angle ?.
Hypotenuse (hyp)
Adjacent (adj)
Opposite
(opp)
With reference to the above triangle, for an acute angle ? (that is, 0 = ? < p/2), the six
trigonometric functions can be described as follows:
sin ? =
opp
hyp
csc ? =
hyp
opp
cos ? =
adj
hyp
sec ? =

tan ? =

cot ? =

321.3. TRIGONOMETRY
Mnemonic
The mnemonic SOH CAH TOA is useful in remembering how trigonometric functions
of acute angles relate to the sides of a right triangle.
This description does not apply to obtuse or negative angles. To define the six basic
trigonometric functions we first define sine and cosine as the lengths of various line segments
from a unit circle, and then we define the remaining four basic trigonometric functions in
terms of sine and cosine.
Take a line originating at the origin (making an angle of ? with the positive half of
the x-axis) and suppose this line intersects the unit circle at the point (x, y). The x- and
y-coordinates of this point of intersection are equal to cos ? and sin ?, respectively.
1
For angles greater than 2p or less than -2p, simply continue to rotate around the circle. In
this way, sine and cosine become periodic functions with period 2p:
sin ? = sin (? + 2pk) cos ? = cos (? + 2pk)
for any angle ? and any integer k.
Above, only sine and cosine were defined directly by the circle. We now define the
remaining four basic trigonometric functions in terms of the functions sin ? and cos ?:
tan ? =
sin ?
cos ?
sec ? =

csc ? =

cot ? =

1.3.3. Computing Exact Trigonometric Ratios
The unit circle is often used to determine the exact value of a particular trigonometric
function.
33CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
Reading from the unit circle one can see that cos 5p/6 = -v3/2 and sin 5p/6 = 1/2
(remember the that the x-coordinate is cos ? and the y-coordinate is sin ?). However, we don’t
always have access to the unit circle. In this case, we can compute the exact trigonometric
ratios for ? = 5p/6 by using special triangles and the CAST rule described below.
The first special triangle has angles of 45?, 45?, 90? (i.e., p/4, p/4, p/2) with side lengths
1, 1,v2, while the second special triangle has angles of 30?, 60?, 90? (i.e., p/6, p/3, p/2) with
side lengths 1, 2,v3. They are classically referred to as the 1 - 1 - v2 triangle, and the
1 - 2 - v3 triangle, respectively, shown below.
341.3. TRIGONOMETRY
Mnemonic
The first triangle should be easy to remember. To remember the second triangle,
place the largest number (2) across from the largest angle (90? = p/2). Place the
smallest number (1) across from the smallest angle (30? = p/6). Place the middle
number (v3 ˜ 1.73) across from the middle angle (60? = p/3). Double check using
the Pythagorean Theorem that the sides satisfy a2 + b2 = c2.
The special triangles allow us to compute the exact value (excluding the sign) of trigonometric
ratios, but to determine the sign, we can use the CAST rule.
The CAST Rule
The CAST rule says that in quadrant I all three of sin ?, cos ?, tan ? are positive. In
quadrant II, only sin ? is positive, while cos ?, tan ? are negative. In quadrant III, only
tan ? is positive, while sin ?, cos ? are negative. In quadrant IV, only cos ? is positive,
while sin ?, tan ? are negative. To remember this, simply label the quadrants by the
letters C-A-S-T starting in the bottom right and labelling counter-clockwise.

Example 1.36: Determining Trigonometric Ratios Without Unit Circle
Determine sin 5p/6, cos 5p/6, tan 5p/6, sec 5p/6, csc 5p/6 and cot 5p/6 exactly by
using the special triangles and CAST rule.
Solution.We start by drawing the xy-plane and indicating our angle of 5p/6 in standard position
(positive angles rotate counterclockwise while negative angles rotate clockwise). Next,

we drop a perpendicular to the x-axis (never drop it to the y-axis!).
Notice that we can now figure out the angles in the triangle. Since 180? = p, we have an
interior angle of p - 5p/6 = p/6 inside the triangle. As the angles of a triangle add up to
180? = p, the other angle must be p/3. This gives one of our special triangles. We label it
accordingly and add the CAST rule to our diagram.
C
S A
T
From the above figure we see that 5p/6 lies in quadrant II where sin ? is positive and cos ?
and tan ? are negative. This gives us the sign of sin ?, cos ? and tan ?. To determine the
value we use the special triangle and SOH CAH TOA.
Using sin ? = opp/hyp we find a value of 1/2. But sin ? is positive in quadrant II,
therefore,

Example 1.37: CAST Rule
If cos ? = 3/7 and 3p/2 < ? < 2p, then find cot ?.
Solution. We first draw a right angle triangle. Since cos ? = adj/hyp = 3/7, we let the
adjacent side have length 3 and the hypotenuse have length 7.
adj = 3
hyp = 7
opp = ?
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have 32 + (opp)2 = 72. Thus, the opposite side has
length v40.
adj = 3
hyp = 7
opp =
To find cot ? we use the definition:
cot ? =
1
tan ?
.
Since we are given 3p/2 < ? < 2p, we are in the fourth quadrant. By the CAST rule, tan ?
is negative in this quadrant. As tan ? = opp/adj, it has a value of v40/3, but by the CAST
rule it is negative, that is,
tan ? = -

The graph of the functions sin x and cos x can be visually represented as:
Both sin x and cos x have domain (-8,8) and range [-1, 1]. That is,

The zeros of sin x occur at the integer multiples of p, that is, sin x = 0 whenever x = np,
where n is an integer. Similarly, cos x = 0 whenever x = p/2 + np, where n is an integer.

1.3.5. Trigonometric Identities
There are numerous trigonometric identities, including those relating to shift/periodicity,
Pythagoras type identities, double-angle formulas, half-angle formulas and addition formulas.
We list these below.

? tan(? + f) =

1 - tan ? tan f
? sin(?-f) = sin ? cos f-cos ? sin f
? cos(?-f) = cos ? cos f+sin ? sin f
Example 1.38: Double Angle
Find all values of x with 0 = x = p such that sin 2x = sin x.
Solution. Using the double-angle formula sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x we have:
2 sin x cos x = sin x
2 sin x cos x - sin x = 0
sin x(2 cos x - 1) = 0
Thus, either sin x = 0 or cos x = 1/2. For the first case when sin x = 0, we get x = 0 or
x = p. For the second case when cos x = 1/2, we get x = p/3 (use the special triangles and
CAST rule to get this). Thus, we have three solutions: x = 0, x = p/3, x = p. ?

402. Functions
2.1 What is a Function?
A function y = f(x) is a rule for determining y when we’re given a value of x. For example,
the rule y = f(x) = 2x + 1 is a function. Any line y = mx + b is called a linear function.
The graph of a function looks like a curve above (or below) the x-axis, where for any value
of x the rule y = f(x) tells us how far to go above (or below) the x-axis to reach the curve.
Functions can be defined in various ways: by an algebraic formula or several algebraic
formulas, by a graph, or by an experimentally determined table of values. In the latter
case, the table gives a bunch of points in the plane, which we might then interpolate with a
smooth curve, if that makes sense.
Given a value of x, a function must give at most one value of y. Thus, vertical lines are
not functions. For example, the line x = 1 has infinitely many values of y if x = 1. It is also
true that if x is any number (not 1) there is no y which corresponds to x, but that is not a
problem—only multiple y values is a problem.
One test to identify whether or not a curve in the (x, y) coordinate system is a function
is the following.
Theorem 2.1: The Vertical Line Test
A curve in the (x, y) coordinate system represents a function if and only if no vertical
line intersects the curve more than once.
In addition to lines, another familiar example of a function is the parabola y = f(x) = x2.
We can draw the graph of this function by taking various values of x (say, at regular intervals)
and plotting the points (x, f(x)) = (x, x2). Then connect the points with a smooth curve.
(See figure 2.1.)
The two examples y = f(x) = 2x+1 and y = f(x) = x2 are both functions which can be
evaluated at any value of x from negative infinity to positive infinity. For many functions,
however, it only makes sense to take x in some interval or outside of some “forbidden” region.
The interval of x-values at which we’re allowed to evaluate the function is called the domain
of the function.

y = f(x) = 1/x
Figure 2.1: Some graphs.
Example 2.2: Domain of the Square-Root Function
The square-root function y = f(x) = vx is the rule which says, given an x-value,
take the nonnegative number whose square is x. This rule only makes sense if x = 0.
We say that the domain of this function is x = 0, or more formally {x ? R : x = 0}.
Alternately, we can use interval notation, and write that the domain is [0,8). The
fact that the domain of y = vx is [0,8) means that in the graph of this function (see
figure 2.1) we have points (x, y) only above x-values on the right side of the x-axis.
Another example of a function whose domain is not the entire x-axis is: y = f(x) = 1/x,
the reciprocal function. We cannot substitute x = 0 in this formula. The function makes
sense, however, for any nonzero x, so we take the domain to be: {x ? R : x 6= 0}. The
graph of this function does not have any point (x, y) with x = 0. As x gets close to 0 from
either side, the graph goes off toward infinity. We call the vertical line x = 0 an asymptote.
To summarize, two reasons why certain x-values are excluded from the domain of a function
are the following.
Restrictions for the Domain of a Function
1. We cannot divide by zero, and
2. We cannot take the square root of a negative number.
We will encounter some other ways in which functions might be undefined later.
Another reason why the domain of a function might be restricted is that in a given
situation the x-values outside of some range might have no practical meaning. For example,
if y is the area of a square of side x, then we can write y = f(x) = x2. In a purely
mathematical context the domain of the function y = x2 is all of R. However, in the storyproblem
context of finding areas of squares, we restrict the domain to positive values of x,
because a square with negative or zero side makes no sense.
In a problem in pure mathematics, we usually take the domain to be all values of x at
which the formulas can be evaluated. However, in a story problem there might be further
restrictions on the domain because only certain values of x are of interest or make practical
sense.
422.1. WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
In a story problem, we often use letters other than x and y. For example, the volume V
of a sphere is a function of the radius r, given by the formula V = f(r) = 4
3pr3. Also, letters
different from f may be used. For example, if y is the velocity of something at time t, we
may write y = v(t) with the letter v (instead of f) standing for the velocity function (and t
playing the role of x).
The letter playing the role of x is called the independent variable, and the letter
playing the role of y is called the dependent variable (because its value “depends on”
the value of the independent variable). In story problems, when one has to translate from
English into mathematics, a crucial step is to determine what letters stand for variables. If
only words and no letters are given, then we have to decide which letters to use. Some letters
are traditional. For example, almost always, t stands for time.
Example 2.3: Open Box
An open-top box is made from an a×b rectangular piece of cardboard by cutting out
a square of side x from each of the four corners, and then folding the sides up and
sealing them with duct tape. Find a formula for the volume V of the box as a function
of x, and find the domain of this function.
Solution. The box we get will have height x and rectangular base of dimensions a - 2x by
b - 2x. Thus,
V = f(x) = x(a - 2x)(b - 2x).
Here a and b are constants, and V is the variable that depends on x, i.e., V is playing the
role of y.
This formula makes mathematical sense for any x, but in the story problem the domain
is much less. In the first place, x must be positive. In the second place, it must be less than
half the length of either of the sides of the cardboard. Thus, the domain is

x ? R : 0 < x <
1
2
(minimum of a and b)

.
In interval notation we write: the domain is the interval (0,min(a, b)/2). You might think
about whether we could allow 0 or (the minimum of a and b) to be in the domain. They
make a certain physical sense, though we normally would not call the result a box. If we
were to allow these values, what would the corresponding volumes be? Does that volume
make sense? ?
Example 2.4: Circle of Radius r Centered at the Origin
Is the circle of radius r centered at the origin the graph of a a function?
Solution. The equation for this circle is usually given in the form x2 + y2 = r2. To write
the equation in the form y = f(x) we solve for y, obtaining y = ±vr2 - x2. But this is not
a function, because when we substitute a value in (-r, r) for x there are two corresponding
values of y. To get a function, we must choose one of the two signs in front of the square root.
If we choose the positive sign, for example, we get the upper semicircle y = f(x) = vr2 - x2
(see figure 2.2). The domain of this function is the interval [-r, r], i.e., x must be between
43CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
-r and r (including the endpoints). If x is outside of that interval, then r2 -x2 is negative,
and we cannot take the square root. In terms of the graph, this just means that there are
no points on the curve whose x-coordinate is greater than r or less than -r. ?

Figure 2.2: Upper semicircle y = vr2 - x2.
Example 2.5: Domain
Find the domain of
y = f(x) =
1
v4x - x2
.
Solution. To answer this question, we must rule out the x-values that make 4x-x2 negative
(because we cannot take the square root of a negative number) and also the x-values that
make 4x - x2 zero (because if 4x - x2 = 0, then when we take the square root we get 0,
and we cannot divide by 0). In other words, the domain consists of all x for which 4x - x2
is strictly positive. The inequality 4x - x2 > 0 was solved in Example 1.12. In interval
notation, the domain is the interval (0, 4). ?
A function does not always have to be given by a single formula as the next example
demonstrates.
Example 2.6: Piecewise Velocity
Suppose that y = v(t) is the velocity function for a car which starts out from rest
(zero velocity) at time t = 0; then increases its speed steadily to 20 m/sec, taking 10
seconds to do this; then travels at constant speed 20 m/sec for 15 seconds; and finally
applies the brakes to decrease speed steadily to 0, taking 5 seconds to do this. The
formula for y = v(t) is different in each of the three time intervals: first y = 2x, then
y = 20, then y = -4x + 120. The graph of this function is shown in figure 2.3.

2.2 Transformations and Compositions
45CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
2.2.1. Tranformations
Transformations are operations we can apply to a function in order to obtain a new
function. The most common transformations include translations, stretches and reflections.
We summarize these below.
Function Conditions How to graph F(x) given the graph of f(x)
F(x) = f(x) + c c > 0 Shift f(x) upwards by c units
F(x) = f(x) - c c > 0 Shift f(x) downwards by c units
F(x) = f(x + c) c > 0 Shift f(x) to the left by c units
F(x) = f(x - c) c > 0 Shift f(x) to the right by c units
F(x) = -f(x) Reflect f(x) about the x-axis
F(x) = f(-x) Reflect f(x) about the y-axis
F(x) = |f(x)| Take the part of the graph of f(x) that lies
below the x-axis and reflect it about the x-axis
For horizontal and vertical stretches, different resources use different terminology and
notation. Use the one you are most comfortable with! Below, both a, b are positive numbers.
Note that we only use the term stretch in this case:
Function Conditions How to graph F(x) given the graph of f(x)
F(x) = af(x) a > 0 Stretch f(x) vertically by a factor of a
F(x) = f(bx) b > 0 Stretch f(x) horizontally by a factor of 1/b
In the next case, we use both the terms stretch and shrink. We also split up vertical
stretches into two cases (0 < a < 1 and a > 1), and split up horizontal stretches into two
cases (0 < b < 1 and b > 1). Note that having 0 < a < 1 is the same as having 1/c with
c > 1. Also note that stretching by a factor of 1/c is the same as shrinking by a factor c.
Function Conditions How to graph F(x) given the graph of f(x)
F(x) = cf(x) c > 1 Stretch f(x) vertically by a factor of c
F(x) = (1/c)f(x) c > 1 Shrink f(x) vertically by a factor of c
F(x) = f(cx) c > 1 Shrink f(x) horizontally by a factor of c
F(x) = f(x/c) c > 1 Stretch f(x) horizontally by a factor of c
Some resources keep the condition 0 < c < 1 rather than using 1/c. This is illustrated in
the next table.
Function Conditions How to graph F(x) given the graph of f(x)
F(x) = df(x) d > 1 Stretch f(x) vertically by a factor of d
F(x) = df(x) 0 < d < 1 Shrink f(x) vertically by a factor of 1/d
F(x) = f(dx) d > 1 Shrink f(x) horizontally by a factor of d
F(x) = f(dx) 0 < d < 1 Stretch f(x) horizontally by a factor of 1/d
462.2. TRANSFORMATIONS AND COMPOSITIONS
Example 2.7: Transformations and Graph Sketching
In this example we will use appropriate transformations to sketch the graph of the
function y = |vx + 2 - 1| - 1.
Solution. We start with the graph of a function we know how to sketch, in particular,
y = vx: To obtain the graph of the function y = vx + 2 from the graph y = vx, we must
shift y = vx to the left by 2 units. To obtain the graph of the function y = vx + 2-1 from
the graph y = vx + 2, we must shift y = vx + 2 downwards by 1 unit.

To obtain the graph of the function y = |vx + 2 - 1| from the graph y = vx + 2 - 1, we
must take the part of the graph of y = vx + 2 - 1 that lies below the x-axis and reflect it
(upwards) about the x-axis. Finally, to obtain the graph of the function y = |vx + 2-1|-1
from the graph y = |vx + 2 - 1|, we must shift y = |vx + 2 - 1| downwards by 1 unit:

2.2.2. Combining Two Functions
Let f and g be two functions. Then we can form new functions by adding, subtracting,
multiplying, or dividing. These new functions, f + g, f - g, fg and f/g, are defined in the
usual way.
Operations on Functions
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) (f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)
(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x)

47CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
Suppose Df is the domain of f and Dg is the domain of g. Then the domains of f + g,
f - g and fg are the same and are equal to the intersection Df n Dg (that is, everything
that is in common to both the domain of f and the domain of g). Since division by zero is
not allowed, the domain of f/g is {x ? Df n Dg : g(x) 6= 0}.
Another way to combine two functions f and g together is a procedure called composition.
Function Composition
Given two functions f and g, the composition of f and g, denoted by f ?g, is defined
as:
(f ? g)(x) = f(g(x)).
The domain of f ? g is {x ? Dg : g(x) ? Df}, that is, it contains all values x in the
domain of g such that g(x) is in the domain of f.
Example 2.8: Domain of a Composition
Let f(x) = x2 and g(x) = vx. Find the domain of f ? g.
Solution. The domain of f is Df = {x ? R}. The domain of g is Dg = {x ? R : x = 0}.
The function (f ? g)(x) = f(g(x)) is:
f(g(x)) =
??vx
2 = x.
Typically, h(x) = x would have a domain of {x ? R}, but since it came from a composed
function, we must consider g(x) when looking at the domain of f(g(x)). Thus, the domain
of f ? g is {x ? R : x = 0}. ?
Example 2.9: Combining Two Functions
Let f(x) = x2 +3 and g(x) = x-2. Find f +g, f -g, fg, f/g, f ? g and g ? f. Also,
determine the domains of these new functions.
Solution. For f + g we have:
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = (x2 + 3) + (x - 2) = x2 + x + 1.
For f - g we have:
(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x) = (x2 + 3) - (x - 2) = x2 + 3 - x + 2 = x2 - x + 5.
For fg we have:
(fg)(x) = f(x) · g(x) = (x2 + 3)(x - 2) = x3 - 2x2 + 3x - 6.
For f/g we have: 

f - g and fg are the same and are equal to the intersection Df n Dg (that is, everything
that is in common to both the domain of f and the domain of g). Since division by zero is

Function Composition
Given two functions f and g, the composition of f and g, denoted by f ?g, is defined
as:
(f ? g)(x) = f(g(x)).
The domain of f ? g is {x ? Dg : g(x) ? Df}, that is, it contains all values x in the
domain of g such that g(x) is in the domain of f.
Example 2.8: Domain of a Composition
Let f(x) = x2 and g(x) = vx. Find the domain of f ? g.
Solution. The domain of f is Df = {x ? R}. The domain of g is Dg = {x ? R : x = 0}.
The function (f ? g)(x) = f(g(x)) is:
f(g(x)) =
??vx
2 = x.
Typically, h(x) = x would have a domain of {x ? R}, but since it came from a composed

Example 2.9: Combining Two Functions
Let f(x) = x2 +3 and g(x) = x-2. Find f +g, f -g, fg, f/g, f ? g and g ? f. Also,
determine the domains of these new functions.
Solution. For f + g we have:
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) = (x2 + 3) + (x - 2) = x2 + x + 1.
For f - g we have:
(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x) = (x2 + 3) - (x - 2) = x2 + 3 - x + 2 = x2 - x + 5.
For fg we have:
(fg)(x) = f(x) · g(x) = (x2 + 3)(x - 2) = x3 - 2x2 + 3x - 6.
For f/g we have: 

482.3. EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
For f ? g we have:
(f ? g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x - 2) = (x - 2)2 + 3 = x2 - 4x + 7.
For g ? f we have:
(g ? f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x2 + 3) = (x2 + 3) - 2 = x2 + 1.
The domains of f + g, f - g, fg, f ? g and g ? f is {x ? R}, while the domain of f/g is
{x ? R : x 6= 2}. ?
As in the above problem, f ? g and g ? f are generally different functions.

2.3 Exponential Functions
An exponential function is a function of the form f(x) = ax, where a is a constant.
Examples are 2x, 10x and (1/2)x. To more formally define the exponential function we look
at various kinds of input values.
49CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
It is obvious that a5 = a·a·a·a·a and a3 = a·a·a, but when we consider an exponential
function ax we can’t be limited to substituting integers for x. What does a2.5 or a-1.3 or
a mean? And is it really true that a2.5a-1.3 = a2.5-1.3? The answer to the first question is
actually quite difficult, so we will evade it; the answer to the second question is “yes.”
We’ll evade the full answer to the hard question, but we have to know something about
exponential functions. You need first to understand that since it’s not “obvious” what 2x
should mean, we are really free to make it mean whatever we want, so long as we keep the
behavior that is obvious, namely, when x is a positive integer. What else do we want to be
true about 2x? We want the properties of the previous two paragraphs to be true for all
exponents: 2x2y = 2x+y and (2x)y = 2xy.
After the positive integers, the next easiest number to understand is 0: 20 = 1. You have
presumably learned this fact in the past; why is it true? It is true precisely because we want
2a2b = 2a+b to be true about the function 2x. We need it to be true that 202x = 20+x = 2x,
and this only works if 20 = 1. The same argument implies that a0 = 1 for any a.
The next easiest set of numbers to understand is the negative integers: for example,
2-3 = 1/23. We know that whatever 2-3 means it must be that 2-323 = 2-3+3 = 20 = 1,
which means that 2-3 must be 1/23. In fact, by the same argument, once we know what 2x
means for some value of x, 2-x must be 1/2x and more generally a-x = 1/ax.
Next, consider an exponent 1/q, where q is a positive integer. We want it to be true that
(2x)y = 2xy, so (21/q)q = 2. This means that 21/q is a q-th root of 2, 21/q = vq 2 . This is all
we need to understand that 2p/q = (21/q)p = ( vq 2 )p and ap/q = (a1/q)p = (vq a )p.
What’s left is the hard part: what does 2x mean when x cannot be written as a fraction,
like x = v2 or x = p? What we know so far is how to assign meaning to 2x whenever
x = p/q. If we were to graph ax (for some a > 1) at points x = p/q then we’d see something
like this:
x
y
This is a poor picture, but it illustrates a series of individual points above the rational
numbers on the x-axis. There are really a lot of “holes” in the curve, above x = p, for
example. But (this is the hard part) it is possible to prove that the holes can be “filled in”,
and that the resulting function, called ax, really does have the properties we want, namely
502.3. EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
that axay = ax+y and (ax)y = axy. Such a graph would then look like this:
x
y
Three Types of Exponential Functions
There are three kinds of exponential functions f(x) = ax depending on whether a > 1,
a = 1 or 0 < a < 1:
x
y
x
y
x
y
Properties of Exponential Functions
The first thing to note is that if a < 0 then problems can occur. Observe that if a = -1
then (-1)x is not defined for every x. For example, x = 1/2 is a square root and gives
(-1)1/2 = v-1 which is not a real number.
Exponential Function Properties
? Only defined for positive a: ax is only defined for all real x if a > 0
? Always positive: ax > 0, for all x
? Exponent rules:
1. axay = ax+y
2.
ax
ay = ax-y
3. (ax)y = axy = ayx = (ay)x
4. axbx = (ab)x
? Long term behaviour: If a > 1, then ax ? 8 as x ? 8 and ax ? 0 as x ? -8.
The last property can be observed from the graph. If a > 1, then as x gets larger and
larger, so does ax. On the other hand, as x gets large and negative, the function approaches
51CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
the x-axis, that is, ax approaches 0.
Example 2.10: Reflection of Exponential
Determine an equation of the function after reflecting y = 2x about the line x = -2.
Solution. First reflect about the y-axis to get y = 2-x. Now shift by 2 × 2 = 4 units to the
left to get y = 2-(x+4). Side note: Can you see why this sequence of transformations is the
same as reflection in the line x = -2? Can you come up with a general rule for these types
of reflections? ?
Example 2.11: Determine the Exponential Function
Determine the exponential function f(x) = kax that passes through the points (1, 6)
and (2, 18).
Solution. We substitute our two points into the equation to get:
x = 1, y = 6 ? 6 = ka1
x = 2, y = 18 ? 18 = ka2
This gives us 6 = ka and 18 = ka2. The first equation is k = 6/a and subbing this into the
second gives: 18 = (6/a)a2. Thus, 18 = 6a and a = 3. Now we can see from 6 = ka that
k = 2. Therefore, the exponential function is
f(x) = 2 · 3x.
?
There is one base that is so important and convenient that we give it a special symbol.
This number is denoted by e = 2.71828 . . . (and is an irrational number). Its importance
stems from the fact that it simplifies many formulas of Calculus and also shows up in other
fields of mathematics.
Example 2.12: Domain of Function with Exponential
Find the domain of f(x) =
1
vex + 1
.
Solution. For domain, we cannot divide by zero or take the square root of negative numbers.
Note that one of the properties of exponentials is that they are always positive! Thus,
ex + 1 > 0 (in fact, as ex > 0 we actually have that ex + 1 is at least one). Therefore, ex + 1
is never zero nor negative, and gives no restrictions on x. Thus, the domain is R. ?

2.4 Inverse Functions
In mathematics, an inverse is a function that serves to “undo” another function. That is,
if f(x) produces y, then putting y into the inverse of f produces the output x. A function
f that has an inverse is called invertible and the inverse is denoted by f-1. It is best to
illustrate inverses using an arrow diagram:

Notice how f maps 1 to a, and f-1 undoes this, that is, f-1 maps a back to 1. Don’t confuse
f-1(x) with exponentiation: the inverse f-1 is different from 1
f(x) .
Not every function has an inverse. It is easy to see that if a function f(x) is going to have
an inverse, then f(x) never takes on the same value twice. We give this property a special
name.
A function f(x) is called one-to-one if every element of the range corresponds to exactly
one element of the domain. Similar to the Vertical Line Test (VLT) for functions, we have
the Horizontal Line Test (HLT) for the one-to-one property.
Theorem 2.13: The Horizontal Line Test
A function is one-to-one if and only if there is no horizontal line that intersects its
graph more than once.
Example 2.14: Parabola is Not One-to-one
The parabola f(x) = x2 it not one-to-one because it does not satisfy the horizontal
line test. For example, the horizontal line y = 1 intersects the parabola at two points,
when x = -1 and x = 1.
We now formally define the inverse of a function.
53CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
Definition 2.15: Inverse of a Function
Let f(x) and g(x) be two one-to-one functions. If (f ? g)(x) = x and (g ? f)(x) = x
then we say that f(x) and g(x) are inverses of each other. We denote g(x) (the
inverse of f(x)) by g(x) = f-1(x).
Thus, if f maps x to y, then f-1 maps y back to x. This gives rise to the cancellation
formulas:
f-1(f(x)) = x, for every x in the domain of f(x),
f(f-1(x)) = x, for every x in the domain of f-1(x).
Example 2.16: Finding the Inverse at Specific Values
If f(x) = x9 + 2x7 + x + 1, find f-1(5) and f-1(1).
Solution. Rather than trying to compute a formula for f-1 and then computing f-1(5),
we can simply find a number c such that f evaluated at c gives 5. Note that subbing in
some simple values (x = -3,-2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3) and evaluating f(x) we eventually find that
f(1) = 19 + 2(17) + 1 + 1 = 5 and f(0) = 1. Therefore, f-1(5) = 1 and f-1(1) = 0. ?
To compute the equation of the inverse of a function we use the following guidelines.
Guidelines for Computing Inverses
1. Write down y = f(x).
2. Solve for x in terms of y.
3. Switch the x’s and y’s.
4. The result is y = f-1(x).
Example 2.17: Finding the Inverse Function
We find the inverse of the function f(x) = 2x3 + 1.
Solution. Starting with y = 2x3 + 1 we solve for x as follows:
y - 1 = 2x3 ?

= x3 ? x = 3

Therefore, f-1(x) = 3

This example shows how to find the inverse of a function algebraically. But what about
finding the inverse of a function graphically? Step 3 (switching x and y) gives us a good
graphical technique to find the inverse, namely, for each point (a, b) where f(a) = b, sketch

2.5 Logarithms
Recall the three kinds of exponential functions f(x) = ax depending on whether 0 < a < 1,
a = 1 or a > 1:
x
y
x
y
x
y
So long as a 6= 1, the function f(x) = ax satisfies the horizontal line test and therefore has
an inverse. We call the inverse of ax the logarithmic function with base a and denote
it by loga. In particular,
loga x = y ?? ay = x.
55CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
The cancellation formulas for logs are:
loga(ax) = x, for every x ? R,
aloga(x) = x, for every x > 0.
Since the function f(x) = ax for a 6= 1 has domain R and range (0,8), the logarithmic
function has domain (0,8) and range R. For the most part, we only focus on logarithms
with a base larger than 1 (i.e., a > 1) as these are the most important.
x
y
Notice that every logarithm passes through the point (1, 0) in the same way that every
exponential function passes through the point (0, 1).
Some properties of logarithms are as follows.
Logarithm Properties
Let A,B be positive numbers and b > 0 (b 6= 1) be a base.

since 23 = 8.
The Natural Logarithm
As mentioned earlier for exponential functions, the number e ˜ 2.71828 . . . is the most
convenient base to use in Calculus. For this reason we give the logarithm with base e a
special name: the natural logarithm. We also give it special notation:
loge x = ln x.
You may pronounce ln as either: “el - en”, “lawn”, or refer to it as “natural log”. The
above properties of logarithms also apply to the natural logarithm.
Often we need to turn a logarithm (in a different base) into a natural logarithm. This
gives rise to the change of base formula.

Example 2.19: Combine Logarithms
Write lnA + 2 lnB - lnC as a single logarithm.

x + 2 = ln 6 + 2x
x = 2 - ln 6
?
Example 2.21: Solve Logarithm Equations using Exponentials
If ln(2x - 1) = 2 ln(x), then solve for x.
Solution. “Taking e” of both sides and noting the cancellation formulas, we have:
eln(2x-1) = e2 ln(x)
(2x - 1) = eln(x2)
2x - 1 = x2
x2 - 2x + 1 = 0
(x - 1)2 = 0
Therefore, the solution is x = 1. ?

582.6. INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
2.6 Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The trigonometric functions frequently arise in problems, and often it is necessary to invert
the functions, for example, to find an angle with a specified sine. Of course, there are many
angles with the same sine, so the sine function doesn’t actually have an inverse that reliably
“undoes” the sine function. If you know that sin x = 0.5, you can’t reverse this to discover x,
that is, you can’t solve for x, as there are infinitely many angles with sine 0.5. Nevertheless,
it is useful to have something like an inverse to the sine, however imperfect. The usual
approach is to pick out some collection of angles that produce all possible values of the sine
exactly once. If we “discard” all other angles, the resulting function does have a proper
inverse.
The sine takes on all values between -1 and 1 exactly once on the interval [-p/2, p/2].
If we truncate the sine, keeping only the interval [-p/2, p/2], then this truncated sine has
an inverse function. We call this the inverse sine or the arcsine, and write it in one of two
common notation: y = arcsin(x), or y = sin-1(x).
Recall that a function and its inverse undo each other in either order, for example,
(v3 x)3 = x and v3 x3 = x. This does not work with the sine and the “inverse sine” because
the inverse sine is the inverse of the truncated sine function, not the real sine function. It
is true that sin(arcsin(x)) = x, that is, the sine undoes the arcsine. It is not true that the
arcsine undoes the sine, for example, sin(5p/6) = 1/2 and arcsin(1/2) = p/6, so doing first
the sine then the arcsine does not get us back where we started. This is because 5p/6 is not
59CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
in the domain of the truncated sine. If we start with an angle between -p/2 and p/2 then
the arcsine does reverse the sine: sin(p/6) = 1/2 and arcsin(1/2) = p/6.
Example 2.22: Arcsine of Common Values
Compute sin-1(0), sin-1(1) and sin-1(-1).
Solution. These come directly from the graph of y = arcsin x:
sin-1 (0) = 0 sin-1(1) =
p
2
sin-1(-1) = -
p
2
?
We can do something similar for the cosine function. As with the sine, we must first
truncate the cosine so that it can be inverted, in particular, we use the interval [0, p].
Note that the truncated cosine uses a different interval than the truncated sine, so that if
y = arccos(x) we know that 0 = y = p.
602.6. INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Example 2.23: Arccosine of Common Values
Compute cos-1(0), cos-1(1) and cos-1(-1).
Solution. These come directly from the graph of y = arccos x:
cos-1 (0) =
p
2
cos-1(1) = 0 cos-1(-1) = p
?
Finally we look at the tangent; the other trigonometric functions also have “partial
inverses” but the sine, cosine and tangent are enough for most purposes. The truncated
tangent uses an interval of (-p/2, p/2).
Reflecting the truncated tangent in the line y = x gives the arctangent function.
61CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
Example 2.24: Arctangent of Common Values
Compute tan-1(0). What value does tan-1 x approach as x gets larger and larger?
What value does tan-1 x approach as x gets large (and negative)?
Solution. These come directly from the graph of y = arctan x. In particular, tan-1(0) = 0.
As x gets larger and larger, tan-1 x approaches a value of 
2 , whereas, as x gets large but
negative, tan-1 x approaches a value of -
2 . ?
The cancellation rules are tricky since we restricted the domains of the trigonometric
functions in order to obtain inverse trig functions:

Solution. Since sin-1(x) outputs values in [-p/2, p/2], the answer must be in this interval.
Let ? = sin-1(1/2). We need to compute ?. Take the sine of both sides to get sin ? =
sin(sin-1(1/2)) = 1/2 by the cancellation rule. There are many angles ? that work, but we

Example 2.26: Arccosine and the Cancellation Rule
Compute cos-1(cos(0)), cos-1(cos(p)), cos-1(cos(2p)), cos-1(cos(3p)).
Solution. Since cos-1(x) outputs values in [0, p], the answers must be in this interval. The
first two we can cancel using the cancellation rules:
cos-1(cos(0)) = 0 and cos-1(cos(p)) = p.
The third one we cannot cancel:
cos-1(cos(2p)) is NOT equal to 2p.
But we know that cos(2p) = cos(0):
cos-1(cos(2p)) = cos-1(cos(0)) = 0
Similarly with the fourth one, we can NOT cancel yet. Using cos(3p) = cos(3p - 2p) =
cos(p):
cos-1(cos(3p)) = cos-1(cos(p)) = p

Example 2.27: The Triangle Technique
Rewrite the expression cos(sin-1 x) without trig functions. Note that the domain of
this function is all x ? [-1, 1].
Solution. Let ? = sin-1 x. We need to compute cos ?. Taking the sine of both sides gives
sin ? = sin(sin-1(x)) = x by the cancellation rule. We then draw a right triangle using
sin ? = x/1:
If z is the remaining side, then by the Pythagorean Theorem:
z2 + x2 = 1 ? z2 = 1 - x2 ? z = ±
v1 - x2
and hence z = +v1 - x2 since ? ? [-p/2, p/2]. Thus, cos ? = v1 - x2 by SOH CAH TOA,
so, cos(sin-1 x) = v1 - x2. ?
Example 2.28: The Triangle Technique 2
For x ? (0, 1), rewrite the expression sin(2 cos-1 x). Compute sin(2 cos-1(1/2)).
Solution. Let ? = cos-1 x so that cos ? = x. The question now asks for us to compute
sin(2?). We then draw a right triangle using cos ? = x/1:
To find sin(2?) we use the double angle formula sin(2?) = 2 sin ? cos ?. But sin ? = v1 - x2
and cos ? = x. Therefore, sin(2 cos-1 x) = 2xv1 - x2. When x = 1/2 we have sin(2 cos-1(1/2)) = v3

2.7 Hyperbolic Functions
The hyperbolic functions appear with some frequency in applications, and are quite similar
in many respects to the trigonometric functions. This is a bit surprising given our initial
definitions.
63CHAPTER 2. FUNCTIONS
Definition 2.29: Hyperbolic Sine and Cosine
The hyperbolic cosine is the function
cosh x =
ex + e-x
2
,
and the hyperbolic sine is the function
sinh x =
ex - e-x
2
.
Notice that cosh is even (that is, cosh(-x) = cosh(x)) while sinh is odd (sinh(-x) =
-sinh(x)), and cosh x + sinh x = ex. Also, for all x, cosh x > 0, while sinh x = 0 if and only
if ex - e-x = 0, which is true precisely when x = 0.
Theorem 2.30: Range of Hyperbolic Cosine
The range of cosh x is [1,8).
Proof. Let y = cosh x. We solve for x:
y =
ex + e-x
2
2y = ex + e-x
2yex = e2x + 1
0 = e2x - 2yex + 1
ex =
2y ±
p
4y2 - 4
2
ex = y ±
p
y2 - 1
From the last equation, we see y2 = 1, and since y = 0, it follows that y = 1.
Now suppose y = 1, so y ±
p
y2 - 1 > 0. Then x = ln(y ±
p
y2 - 1) is a real number,
and y = cosh x, so y is in the range of cosh(x). ?

Certainly the hyperbolic functions do not closely resemble the trigonometric functions
graphically. But they do have analogous properties, beginning with the following identity.
Theorem 2.33: Hyperbolic Identity
For all x in R, cosh2 x - sinh2 x = 1.

Proof. The proof is a straightforward computation:
cosh2 x - sinh2 x =

=
e2x + 2 + e-2x - e2x + 2 - e-2x

4
= 1.
?
This immediately gives two additional identities:
1 - tanh2 x = sech2x and coth2x - 1 = csch2x.
The identity of the theorem also helps to provide a geometric motivation. Recall that
the graph of x2 - y2 = 1 is a hyperbola with asymptotes x = ±y whose x-intercepts are
±1. If (x, y) is a point on the right half of the hyperbola, and if we let x = cosh t, then
y = ±
vx2 - 1 = ±
p
cosh2 x - 1 = ±sinh t. So for some suitable t, cosh t and sinh t are the
coordinates of a typical point on the hyperbola. In fact, it turns out that t is twice the area
shown in the first graph of figure 2.4. Even this is analogous to trigonometry; cos t and sin t
are the coordinates of a typical point on the unit circle, and t is twice the area shown in the
second graph of figure 2.4.
Figure 2.4: Geometric definitions. Here, t is twice the shaded area in each figure.
Since cosh x > 0, sinh x is increasing and hence one-to-one, so sinh x has an inverse,
arcsinhx. Also, sinh x > 0 when x > 0, so cosh x is injective on [0,8) and has a (partial)
inverse, arccoshx. The other hyperbolic functions have inverses as well, though arcsechx is
only a partial inverse.
